      "Hi there! It seems like you may be looking for some information on Dermarolling/Dermastamping. Dermarolling can improve the appearance of atrophic scarring when done correctly. However, there are several risks and I'd like to warn you about them: * You should not be doing this every day. When done in-office, treatments are spaced a few weeks to a month apart. * Done improperly you can end up with hypopigmentation (white or colorless spots in the skin that do not return to a normal color) * It hurts. * You can not fully sterilize the needles at home. They can be sanitized at best. * The needles can become bent over time, or come from the manufacturer already bent. Small bends can be imperceptible to the naked eye and can cause unwanted damage to your skin. **Because of these risks, ScA does not recommend attempting dermarolling or dermastamping at home. Please be careful with your skin and your health!** *If you see that I am replying to something out of context (eg. listed in a routine), please report this comment so my handlers can remove it.

I really appreciate all the support and the positivity being spread around, it\u2019s such an amazing feeling to be happy with your own skin again!! I\u2019ve been having problems with acne for about 5 years now, and for anyone asking or worrying about accutane, I personally wish I\u2019d started it sooner. Of course, I\u2019m not an expert and you should definitely talk with a dermatologist about the drug, but in my case it was really worth it! To just be able to go to the grocery store without any makeup on and not worry about people looking at you is a feeling I haven\u2019t had in a while. I\u2019m extremely thankful that I was able to feel so confident in my dress, standing with my beautiful friends as we went to our graduation banquet last night.

      "When I was super depressed, even just researching and choosing products helped me. Didn\u2019t actually have a routine, but just having something to learn about and focus on, and keeping little lists of imaginary routines helped a lot (actually, this is lame, but using Urstyle which is like Polyvore so I could visualise the routine helped a lot - curbs the urge to buy, buy, buy because for me it mimics the novelty of opening up a shiny new bottle). I still actually use that to plan routines and new purchases. Once I started taking care of my skin it was helpful to have just *some* semblance of routine in my life, something I did twice a day every day at roughly the same time. Sometimes just once was fine, but it was something. I\u2019m an obsessive person and really methodical, so all the research really sated me because I was disinterested in pretty much everything else at the time. It was almost like a perfect depression hobby; time intensive but low effort. The only problem is that if it\u2019s all you\u2019ve got going on for you because you\u2019re at your rock bottom, you can quickly become too results oriented and almost a little dysmorphic. Framing it as self care is helpful, but it\u2019s only self care if it\u2019s accompanied by positive self talk and not driven solely by trying to address a negative (easier said than done if you have serious skin concerns, but important nonetheless). Don\u2019t get all Silicon Valley self optimisation on yourself and you\u2019re alright.",

      "Wow wow wow!!! What amazing results so far! I have just one recommendation (maybe 2) for when you\u2019re left with discolorations on your skin after the acne itself has healed: The Ordinary brand has Alpha Arbutin Serum which has fixed all of my discoloring issues. It\u2019s amazing, and with consist use, I think you could end up with skin showing no evidence of past acne. I LOVE THIS STUFF AND KEEP REPURCHASING IT SO IM NEVER WITHOUT. Another option which has also helped my skin, which may be an even better recommendation than the last, is Urban Rx Skin Clearing bar. It has sulfur, salicylic acid, and kojic acid in it. The first 2 ingredients will continue to fight off acne, and the 3rd (kojic acid) will attack the discoloration issues. I LOVE THIS STUFF AS WELL, & IT LASTS A REALLY LONG TIME! Other than that, it\u2019s clear you have everything else under control. KUDOS TO YOU, & BEST WISHES MOVING FORWARD:)",
      "I think Tretinoin/Retin-A would do wonders for you! It works on both active acne, and on the hyperpigmentation and scars that old acne left behind over time. It's prescription only, but it's easy to get by just asking your general doctor or dermatologist (at the very least, they're still doing telehealth visits, and they should start doing in-person visits again), or even a minute clinic at a CVS or similar. CVS is doing free delivery on prescription meds right now too. There's also online services like Apostrophe and Curology where you fill out a questionnaire and send in pics of your skin. There's also Adapalene/Differin that gets compared to Tretinoin a lot, is over-the-counter, and has less side effects, but it seems like it'll help with scarring less. If getting tret is too inconvenient, I'd consider opting for Adapalene. If you do opt to get a retinoid like the two I mentioned, you'd probably have to drop the retinol serum you were using just to simplify your routine. Come to think of it, Curology or Apostrophe could be a really solid option for you, because they can include Tretinoin as well as antibacterial ingredients into your formula like clindamycin and azelaic acid, which would do the job of benzyl peroxide, so you could simply your routine further. You'd have to ask for it directly, or they'll stick you with some milder formula like they did with me. It's certainly worth considering! :)",
      "Wow! Incredible improvement - you must be feeling great! Might be time to add in a sunscreen to help with hyperpigmentation. I thought every sunscreen made me break out until I started also using an oil cleanser (this is literally the most gentle thing I think you can do to skin, so its not a dramatic step to add). Anyway, looks like you know what you want so enjoy the journey! I find it takes a surprising amount of discipline to change my skin regimen, so go you!",

      "I see you already got lots of good advice, but as someone who also took a nasty fall straight to the face once and came out with zero scarring I'd like to add my input :) *The sad backstory: this happened a few years ago. I was heading home in the dark with heavy shopping bags in both arms. Tripped over the tiniest step and fell. Because my self preservation instincts are great, I held on to the bags and totally saved the eggs, instead of, you know my face...* So there I was looking like I got beat up. After cleaning up and sleeping my sorrows away, I started doing research. The most important think I learned was that scarring occurs because the wounds scab over. To prevent that you need to moisturize the hell out of them. I ordered my supplies: \u2022 Large jar of petroleum jelly (vaseline). *For the moisturizing.* \u2022 Savlon healing gel. *This little miracle creates the perfect conditions for wound healing. As a side note, you can also use it to relieve the pain of burns.* \u2022 Bandaids \u2022 Palmer's cocoa butter. *Seriously, this stuff is amazing for skin.* At least twice per day (definitely before bed though) I would use the healing gel. I liked covering it with a bandaid so that I wouldn't accidentally rub it off. As savlon dries it creates a dry skin like layer, which eventually you wash off (gently) and reapply. I used the vaseline in between, basically as often as I could. And I introduced the cocoa butter once the wounds started getting better. I don't usually use it on my face (only because I read it can make acne issues worse) but this was the exception. And one more thing I did was use compresses created by tissues or cotton pads soaked in hot(ish) tea. I think I alternated between camomile, green and black tea. As for the psychological side of things, I took a picture of my face every day so that I could see the progress. That really helped me not feel so bad about it. I followed this routine and within two weeks most of it was healed. I also had wounds on my arms and knees, but once my face healed up I got so excited I kind of stopped bothering with the routine, and now I still have scars there. Since my face came out completely clear I'm sure I could have avoided scarring there as well if I'd stuck with the routine a bit longer. I hope everything turns out well for you. You deserve all the good karma for saving that bunny! EDIT: also I used no other face products during this time, no regular moisturizer, face wash etc. *Definitely* no acids. When things began to improve I started using my moisturizer on the healthy parts of skin but only the vaseline to moisture the wounds themselves. Also I did use rubbing alcohol (the one meant for wounds that's only like 1%) to clean the wounds on that first day, but not after as I was worried it would cause scarring. But I also kept them clean with water and mostly covered by bandaids.",
      "Omg! Hero alert! I don\u2019t have any tips right now but when it heals a bit, I would say use either vitamin E oil or rose hip oil to minimize scarring. In my experience using niacinamide followed by rose hip helped so much (just with acne scars though). But for right now, just be super super gentle. Also, First Aid Beauty makes a bunch of creams that help restore the skin barrier. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019ll help the healing process but it\u2019ll definitely help when you\u2019re ready to go back to your normal routine.",
      "Oh, my husband had a similar face to face meeting with the pavement, but not while saving a bunny. We did the following and his scars are very light. With further care and time they can probably be less noticable but my husband doesn't care that much. Just to give you perspective, he had to get 21 stitches on his face restitching his face back together above his lip and the bridge of his nose. He washed his face with a clean, non abrasive, zinc and honey soap twice daily. After, as his moisturizer and antibacterial ointment, he used Medicine Mama's product Bee Magic. The soap is also from Medicine Mamas. I can't say enough about the product. It's amazing. I gave some to my cousin for his babies burned hand and it cleared up the burn, saving them from surgery, within a couple of weeks. My husband applied Bee Magic twice a day after washing. Once his open wounds healed, he used a Vit. C serum regularly that is great for the cellular health of the collagen matrix beneath the skin. Super helpful for keeping the skin moisturized and healthy. We use Silver Botanical's Botanical-C Serum. Since the skin and its healing are connected to the gut, he cut out most sugar and gluten hoping to eliminate extra inflammation. He has since added some sugar back and limited gluten. I also asked him to take some enzymes and probiotics. He took an enzyme and anti inflammatory combination by Transformation called Protease IFC in between meals 2 - 3 times a day. Also, 2 probiotics in the evening before bed mostly because he was having to take antibiotics. In your case you might find plenty of probiotics in some foods like yogurt or kimchi. I hope this is helpful.",
      "Agree with everyone saying to see a derm. My only two cents is the Mizon Snail Recovery Gel but only once all wounds are closed and you\u2019re at the stage where it\u2019s just redness. The silicone in this product works wonderfully for my minor scars so might be worth considering. If you use Vit C this is also a great scar fader, but again not on open wounds. You are an angel for saving a little bun and I wish you speedy healing. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have any long term problems here - just be safe with the right docs to avoid infection and be proud of yourself for being such a brave human \ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\udc93",
      "You are a wonderful person! I am very sorry you hurt yourself like this. I would see a dermatologist and get professional advice and products to manage this. I\u2019m sure others have said vitamin E and sunscreen. As for sun damage, I would try to keep your face out of direct sunlight as much as possible, particularly while you are healing! And definitely keep it moist. I personally don\u2019t like Vaseline and would look for another type of salve. I personally like the K Beauty Rescue Balm from Peach & Lily which is petroleum and mineral oil free and has ingredients to help with inflammation and dark spots, which would be great for you right now! You could also look into taking omega pills to give your skin (and brain!) that extra moisture. Best of luck to you and thanks for being a compassionate person"

      "I have visible scars on my face, the most prominent being an approximately 1.5 inch scar on my lower face from a childhood accident. I went through several rounds of painful plastic surgery to minimize the scarring, but over 20 years later it's still obvious. I don't cover it, or put anything on it, or continue to treat it, and I don't wear makeup ever. And I refuse to go through anymore plastic surgery cuz fuck that shit, it sucks. When I first got my scars, I was pretty self conscious about it. Other kids stared. It made me feel uncomfortable. I don't know how, when or why, but eventually I stopped giving a shit. I came to see my scars as unique and beautiful. They aren't flaws or ugly, if anything they make me look pretty cool. So it makes me happy seeing facial scarring as treated as perfectly fine in beauty advertising. Scars should never be seen as ugly. And people shouldn't be made to feel bad for being physically scarred. Edit: I wanted to add since I've gotten so many lovely replies, that whoever you are reading this, just know that you are beautiful!

I used Mary Kay for years and kept my skin clear but my pores were still huge. Flash forward to this winter and I\u2019m really starting to see aging and acne.

      "I had no idea they produced ads like this \ud83e\udd22 I had horrible hormonal(now I know) acne as a child until my early 20's when I went on spironolactone and birth control. I've since gone off BC for health related issues, but I'm still on spiro and found a good skincare routine that works for me, and my facial skin has been amazing. &nbsp; I started getting acne around just 8 years old and my dad pushed this stuff on me like crazy. A few times he took me into the bathroom and literally showed me how to wash my face because he insisted that I either wasn't washing or didn't know how to wash my face properly or use the products because all the famous people on TV said it works. &nbsp; When my mom divorced him and we moved out, I even asked my grandparents for it and they would buy the kits for me whenever they could. My GP was totally against me using Accutane, so I continued using this crap and scrubbing it into my skin super hard. I used the night mask for spot treatment every night. There wasn't much I could do for my back and chest since they were such large surfaces and would use up the products too quickly, so I just assumed I was destined to be \"ugly\" and never have a boyfriend(I made up my mind that if a boy asked me out, I would just say no), be able to wear a bathing suit, or even wear short sleeves or a tank top. I'd wear sweaters in the summer, I'd get laughed at and \"grossss\" in locker rooms. To top it off, my back was also hairy. I definitely had a hormonal issue. &nbsp; I even remember using toothpaste masks because my grandma and I read in a magazine that it'd help. None of it helped, ever, obviously. It made my skin super greasy from stripping it, I always felt embarrassed because I thought I looked \"sweaty\". &nbsp; In my late teens I got on Accutane, but my dermatologist didn't give me the full treatment when he saw it was working for some reason, so I went on it again about a year later. That seems to have made a big difference, and by that time I had realized Proativ was shite, but I was still using some pretty harsh things on my face and would get breakouts on my lower face and upper back a lot. After I went on birth control, they mostly cleared up, but then my new derm recommended spironolactone because he said it looked like I had hormonal acne. &nbsp; Now I use a lot gentler products and make moisturizing my priority. My skin was left horribly scarred by Proativ and years of acne though. It really messed up my self esteem. I still feel weird wearing short sleeves,bathing suits,and tanks, or even letting my bf see my back. Weirdly, he likes my back, but that means he pays attention and I feel uncomfortable that it's so badly scarred. I'm light/medium skinned and I just have tons of pale spots everywhere from scarring. &nbsp; Really angry to see that they'd release an ad like this, after their products made a lot of our skin worse. I would never ever recommend their products to anyone. I was weirded out to see their products at Ulta, and now I think even Sephora carries them? Also, the Kardashians are so wealthy I don't think any of them are using Proactiv if they get a pimple lol. Js. They're so influential that it seems irresponsible to recommend this.",

By day three I had some pretty serious chemical burns that I figured were just a sign of the products working. I came down stairs one morning and my mother let out a scream as she saw how my skin looked... She took me to the doctors that morning, who then referred me to a skin specialist at the hospital via A&E. It took almost 2 months for my skin to recover and it's taken about 10 years for me to start becoming interested in skincare again!

      "Alright... I have been here for 3 or 4 years. I have been lucky to not have acne unlike many of subscribers/submitters. I love to see people more involved in this community. Most of all, I am inspired by your transitions. But, simultaneously, I am afraid to admit my halfway decent complexion. I watch this community as lurker, and after years, until this comment, I haven't had anything to say. My only comment is: Out of some misplaced masculinity, I don't think I could ever subscribe to a face mask regimen. I know my insecurities aren't rational. My goal is moisturizing, sun protection and just healthy maintenance. I just want to take care of my skin (mostly facial) more than my family. Do I need to realize mask are an important part of skin care?",

      "Possibly unpopular opinion, but I absolutely hate sheet masks. They never fit my face properly. I either can\u2019t breathe, can\u2019t see, or can\u2019t open my mouth. Plus they never stay on my face. That, and I\u2019ve never found one that didn\u2019t make me break out. Cream masks all the way. Spreadin\u2019 that goodness on my face for DAYS."

All of my friends were jealous of my skin and would ask for a routine and I would just say I didn\u2019t have one. To be fair I am only 21. I didn\u2019t start having a skincare routine until I started getting dry patches in the morning but super oily skin at night because it\u2019s winter here. I found this sub by looking for a moisturizer. Now I use SA toner, hydro boost, and a face wash. Tbh I havent noticed any difference except Im not as dry and my hormonal acne is less intense around my period. (Basically only one zit instead of 3). I have noticed the texture that I thought was just normal is gone on my nose. That\u2019s pretty sweet. Another reason I started skincare is because I fear that me not caring for my skin now will ruin it in the future and nothing terrifies me more than knowing I could\u2019ve prevented something but didn\u2019t.",
      "I like reading all the fancy routines and seeing the improvement pics, but in truth my skincare routine consists of my bar soap on the days I shower, drugstore Micellar Water on the days I don't, and SPF moisturizer. I get more pimples when my diet isn't as consistently healthy as normal or when I don't drink as much water as normal, but for the most part I'm pretty genetically blessed.",
      "My oily skin does not take a break. Especially since I love sports. Track, volleyball, hockey, I love it all. Since I have bangs, my hair also seems greasy and I must dust my face in powder. I cannot shower without washing my face. I can feel the oil barrier when the water hits me like a wall. I use Pantene's micellar shampoo and I'm not going to lie, the tiniest amount of that micellar soap makes my face feel good. Don't be like me though.",

However, there are several risks and I'd like to warn you about them: * You should not be doing this every day. When done in-office, treatments are spaced a few weeks to a month apart. * Done improperly you can end up with hypopigmentation (white or colorless spots in the skin that do not return to a normal color) * It hurts. * You can not fully sterilize the needles at home. They can be sanitized at best. * The needles can become bent over time, or come from the manufacturer already bent. Small bends can be imperceptible to the naked eye and can cause unwanted damage to your skin. **Because of these risks, ScA does not recommend attempting dermarolling or dermastamping at home. Please be careful with your skin and your health!** *If you see that I am replying to something out of context (eg. listed in a routine), please report this comment so my handlers can remove it.

If you use this daily on your arms you are going to really dry out your skin/damage your moisture barrier (arms dont produce a lot of natural oils), possibly before you see any difference in hair color. As many other people here have suggested, using body hair bleach once every few week will actually be LESS damaging and harsh on your skin than using this as often and for as long as it would take to see results. Any skin darkening from using body hair bleach would be from hyperpigmentation from irritation or increased sun sensitivity\u2014if that\u2019s how your skin reacts to hair bleaching products, it would likely react similarly to daily panoxyl use. Body hair bleach formulated for facial use is probably what you want, so as to minimize chances of irritation."

      "Is it a dry heat or a humid place? Cos i found i need wildly separate routines for those weathers. I'd use the same makeup remover. But for a dryer climate, i'd go for a richer cleanser (maybe one that's not foaming), milky toner, thicker serum, and a lightweight creamy moisturiser. I might even double up on the serum. I'd focus on ceramides, prebiotics and fatty acids. For a more humid weather though, i'd go for a fresher cleanser (probably foaming), very liquidy clear toners (even sometimes more than one, layered), humectant serums, and gels instead of creams for moisturising. And i would double up on toners and gels. Also concentrate more on hyaluronic acid, glycerine and maybe urea (highly hygroscopic).",

I used this when my prescription triluma is retinizing and irritate particular problematic spot on my skin. Calming down inflamed area. - CNP Propolis Energy Ampoule Pad. I took this on vacation in lieu of sheet masks and serums. Used after P Calm Ampoule Pad but before my occlusive moisturizer. While on vacation I don\u2019t like to bring a bunch of liquids in glass bottles or liquids in general - so I bring all toner pads encased in Ziploc bags. Slap it on, lay down to relax; once the pads dry down I peel it away and slap on the next pads - all without getting out of bed.

You can\u2019t peel these in two like the skinfood ones, but they can tear very easily in halves without scissors if you like having smaller pieces to mask your forehead/nose/chin.

I was talking to one client about the general order of an AB skincare routine and ended up giving her references to research more herself because she was genuinely interested. I consider myself more a novice in this area but I am still very passionate about skincare in general. I really wish Sephora had a wider variety of AB products, as I'm finding myself shopping more online, where I can't touch or play with things first. Not to mention I don't get my employee discount >.> And the Nordstrom little pop-up shop that featured K-Beauty brands last month was mildly disappointing. All the little bits of info I don't know yet, (I had no idea the Tatcha rice powder has such a high pH!), I'd love to discuss in person and talk about products that Sephora carries that you like, that you don't like, how you test for pH, what got you into AB, etc etc. It sounds corny but I do like to make a personal connection with clients, and not just because we are supposed to as part of our business model. TLDR: Come into my store and tell me what you know. I love to learn and pass on my knowledge to others to spread the passion and love for AB! Edit: I mean I'm not going to tell you where exactly I work so it'll be hard to visit *me* but I'm basically just asking you to see if any salesperson you encounter might share the same passion for AB, so fun can be had by all :)",

I know it\u2019s probably normal for companies to do this to some degree but it\u2019s my first time encountering such blatant packaging. Honestly I was on the fence about repurchasing it since it smells nice and seems to be a decent lightweight moisturizer (and I thought the price was good for the amount LOL me), but after realizing this, I\u2019m definitely not repurchasing anymore. I like some of innisfree\u2019s other products (sebum care sunscreen, sheet masks, green tea serum) but honestly I\u2019m kind of disappointed in them rn. Thoughts? Does this happen a lot in AB?

      "Lately I've been seeing a lot of questions about the differences between Hada Labo lotions and which lotion is which. It's especially confusing because it seems like there's 2-4 versions of each product (not including the nearly identical milk/emulsion products!) and because of the product names; for example, the main Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion will have a dozen names that differs by each retailer because of minor translation issues. I've also seen some misinformation here on /r/AsianBeauty about these lotions, on a [guide](https://btyaly.com/articles/is-hada-labo-lotion-the-best-hyaluronic-acid-product-on-the-market/) that's been shared on this sub a few times, and on Hada Labo's USA website as well. For example: * The Hada Labo USA's website looks like it is outdated. The Alpha line has been reformulated in 2013 but the website still shows the old ingredients, the Gokujyun line still shows pictures of the old packaging, the new Shirojyun Premium products aren't listed on the website, etc. * [This article](https://btyaly.com/articles/is-hada-labo-lotion-the-best-hyaluronic-acid-product-on-the-market/) that's been shared a few times here lists 3 of the Shirojyun lotions but is missing the 4th, says that the Gokjyun Moist Lotion and Light Lotion both have 4 HAs but they actually have 3, says the Alpha lotion has retinyl palmitate but it doesn't since the reformulation in 2013, only lists 1 Alpha lotion when there are actually 2, etc. So these inaccuracies prompted me to do some DEEP digging between Hada Labo's official Japanese website, numerous reddit posts and comments, beauty blogs, Cosdna ingredients lists, RatzillaCosme, Dokodemo, Kirei Station, Rakuten, etc. Between all of these sources, I tried to make a guide for all the current* Hada Labo lotions that includes their name, alternative names, notable ingredients, basic descriptions, images, recommended for which skin types, how to identify/differentiate the products, etc. To my knowledge, this is the most accurate guide as it heavily relies on Hada Labo's official Japanese website. But please let me know if you spot any errors (and please forgive me if there are \u2565\ufe4f\u2565)!! Hopefully this is helpful to a lot of people and makes shopping a bit easier! (*When I say \"current\" I mean that the Hada Labo Japanese website currently lists them on their product page so presumably they're still being produced and sold.) ----- **Edit:** It turns out in Asian markets, Job's tears can be sold as \"pearl barley\" or \"Chinese pearl barley\". And in America, if something is sold as \"pearl barley\", it's actual barley. So be aware of this if you are shopping specifically for barley products or Job's tears products. **Edit 2:** This guide is based on Hada Labo Japan and which products they are currently selling. It may not align with HL Singapore, HL Malaysia, HL Thailand, HL Vietnam, HL China, HL Taiwan, or HL Indonesia. These HL branches may have other product lines like the AHA+BHA line, the Kouji line, the Blemish & Oil Control line, the Pro Anti Aging line, the Advanced Nourish line, the Perfect White line, the Perfect White Supreme line, etc. **Edit 3:** Idk why or how reddit broke my post but heres the direct url to the picture https://m.imgur.com/KNiJV2g (but the guide is outdated since hada labo reformulated their products)",

      "One question I saw somewhat frequently in the daily help thread is \"I'm going to Japan, what should I buy?\" or \"My SO/friend/family is going to Japan, what should I ask them to buy for me?\" or the occasional post asking \"What are your holy grail Japanese products?\" so a guide like this seemed long overdue. I made a basic list of some of the more popular Japanese brands and products of /r/AsianBeauty, with pictures included to make your shopping trip a little easier. **But because everyone\u2019s skin type, skin concerns, preferences, sensitivities/allergies, routines, and climates are all different, this guide shouldn\u2019t be used as your shopping list. Think of it as a starting point of recommended brands/products to look into, then look at reviews and see which ones interest you and would suit your skin.** Of course this list isn't fully comprehensive (otherwise the guide would be too big, and it kinda already is lol!). Instead I tried to include a variety of product types and variety of brands and to highlight a few star products of each brand (otherwise the Hada Labo section would be 3x bigger since it's such a beloved brand!). But if you think any products were missed and deserve more love, please feel free to share that product in a comment and maybe even leave a review for us :-) I hope ABers find this helpful! My next guide might be about Hada Labo milks/emulsions. And if anyone has other ideas for guides, please suggest them to me. The more specific, the better! (In other words, please don't suggest \"make a guide comparing moisturizers\" because it's too broad of an idea and there's like a hundred popular moisturizers in this sub that can be compared and contrasted in many different ways based on star ingredients, purpose, textures, etc. \u2565\ufe4f\u2565). Footnote: I hope posting this guide isn't in bad taste/isn't misinterpreted as encouraging international travel right now! I originally started this guide back in February/March-ish before the global pandemic happened. I put this guide on the back burner for a while since people shouldn't be travelling internationally, but at this point no one knows how long the pandemic will last so I figured I may as well finish the guide. **Edit:** I accidentally switched the Meishoku Ceracolla Perfect Gel and Meishoku Ceracolla Moisturizing Cream pictures \ud83d\ude05",

      "Hello folks, I\u2019m a 22M and the pictures you see above is from January 2019 to Present day. **Skintype**: Normal - Combination and Sensitive (I used to have oily - skin) **Medication History:** I\u2019ve tried everything since the age of 12\u2026 from drugstore to high end.Nothing worked out until I was recommended to go on \\*\\*Accutane\\*\\*My 7 month course (June - Dec 2020) comprised of dosages of 20mg\u201440mg-60mg-60mg-60mg-60mg-60mg.6 months after my Accutane course, my acne came back! I was not recommended to take another course of Accutane (Dermatologist said my acne was too moderate for a second course in Accutane) and instead I was prescribed to take Tretinoin 0.05%. I applied Tretinoin for 2-3 months and let me just say \u2026 Tretinoin 0.05% completely destroyed my face and my dermatologist told me this was not a purge. I was getting irritation. **The transformation:** I decided to consult with my dermatologist and focus on Asian beauty Products - primarily hydrating and soothing the skin. I currently have no actives in my routine and my main focus is soothing and nourishment. This change in routine has led me to believe that over-treatments and using an abundant amount of active products can truly destroy the integrity of our skin. I thankfully managed to get my skin under control. **Current Routine:** AM * Rinse with water * Laneige Cream Skin Refiner * Soon Jung 2x Intensive Barrier Cream * SPF: Bioderma Photoderm Lait or Anessa Sunscreen Milk (I like this one the most) or La Roche Posay Antheolios Ultra-Light SPF 50 PM * Farmacy Green Clean Cleansing Balm * Krave Beauty Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser * Laneige Cream Skin Refiner * Primera Miracle Seed Essence or I\u2019m from Mugwort Essence (at least 2+ layers and I switch it up \u2026 depends on my mood) * Krave Beauty Great Barrier Relief (This is treating my hyperpigmentation currently. Idk if it works but it feels great) * Etude House Soon Jung 2x Intensive Barrier Cream * Dr Jart Ceramidin Cream (If I\u2019m feeling extra dry)My most favourite and holy grail sunscreen is the Anessa Sunscreen Milk &#x200B; \\*\\*How do you remove scaring or hyperpigmentation?\\*\\*I was extremely fortunate to not suffer scaring issues but I suffered heavily from hyperpigmentation. Extreme reapplication of sunscreen ( I mean it, please take spf seriously) was the key in preventing my pigmentation to become worse. I think providing an adequate hydrated environment prevented me from scarring easily. **Tips and Tricks:** * Clean your earbuds/headset wires. They accumulate a lot of bacteria and cause jawline acne. If you\u2019re wearing Bluetooth wireless earphones, lucky you. * Try not to stress (I stressed out a lot cause I\u2019m in uni so I broke out a lot) * I apply sunscreen 2x a day and I don\u2019t care what anyone says. I don\u2019t care if I look like an idiot with a white cast. I noticed that the more elegant sunscreens are, the efficacy decays. I\u2019ve tried a large array of sunscreens. I prefer higher protection that prevents me from hyperpigmentation than formula elegancy. * Consider the health of the skin, aka the moisture barrier. I over did my treatments, and as a result, I got irritation and broke out. Irritation doesn\u2019t always have to be redness or itchiness. Irritation can be in the form of acne. * I personally am sensitive to essential oils so I avoid it like the plague. It makes my face tingle. * The moment you step out of the shower, apply that toner or moisturizer immediately. Water Loss can cause acne. * FOCUS ON HYDRATION !!!! - I personally am geared towards the asian beauty realm than western beauty and asian beauty realm focuses more on hydration + prevention than treatment. If you have a hydrated environment for your skin, skin regeneration is more rapid. **The most important part:** Acne is one of the main factors in negatively impacting your self-confidence and self-esteem. Do not let anyone invalidate your feelings towards your skin. In addition, to those who have barely struggled with acne and is telling another individual to \u2018clean their face\u2019, \u2018drink lots of water\u2019 or other obvious remedies, please stop. It\u2019s pretty obvious that acne-sufferers have tried everything under the sun to address their issue. Some people can\u2019t begin to understand what it truly feels like to be nervous to smile or laugh because it\u2019ll hurt your acne and life beings to be controlled by it. Many individuals have given up hope but trust me, the very moment when you want to give up, that\u2019s the moment when everything falls into place and there will be light at the end of the tunnel. Please do not give up. Feel free to ask any questions.",

      "You look absolutely gorgeous, and you\u2019re giving me hope! I\u2019ve had acne on-and-off for 16+ years and have been on tretinoin .1% for 13 months with no luck. In the very beginning, dermatologists didn\u2019t take my acne seriously because my skin would be clear for 4 months straight them BOOM a huge hormonal breakout that would take months to heal. As I\u2019ve gotten older, the breakouts have become more and more frequent. One dermatologist recommended Accutane a few years ago, but I declined because I was scared. I wanted to try doxycycline, spironolactone, and tretinoin first. Fast forward to this week: I am now 38 years old, and I am finally starting my very 1st round of Accutane in 30 days! My timing isn\u2019t great, because I actually wanted to get off of birth control soon, but that will just need to wait until my Accutane treatment is done. Wish me luck! I will bookmark your tips. Edit: I love Etude House 2x Intensive Barrier Cream too!"

      "This isn\u2019t only a FOTD, I\u2019ve included a tutorial and review of the white eyeliner I used, which is from a Chinese brand. Please see it after my long-winded explanation \ud83d\ude05 I used to think of my eyelid shape as a limitation in creative eyeliner looks, but I did a look yesterday that I think not only works with my eyelid shape but also accentuates and even celebrates it! I wouldn\u2019t call these Asian eyes (because Asian eyes vary a lot!) but I think this eyelid shape is somehow common in the Asian demographic as well. If you don\u2019t understand the eyelid shape, if you look closely the lashline disappears towards the front of the eye, because it becomes covered by my eyelid. Because of this, even if I extended my eyeliner to the end of my lashline, the last 1-1.5 cm would not be visible. It is a bit visible in the first 2 photos because I tilt my head to the side, but from the front view it isn\u2019t. (See front view here: https://imgur.com/a/0uEd6KW and https://imgur.com/a/Bd8kKaZ) I love the look of the eyeliner extending all the way from one end to the other, but I couldn\u2019t do it! If I tried to line the eyelid that covered up the lashline, there would be a random thick line when I closed my eyes. But I didn\u2019t give up! And I think this somehow unique eyeliner look does justice to my eyeshape and maybe you can do it too! Tutorial: https://imgur.com/a/t2PpPzJ Pls don\u2019t mind the TikTok username, I deleted my account hours after I made it Review: Flortte Eyeliner (Coconut) This particular one is a felt tip, it depends what color if it is felt or brush (for ex. the blue one is brush tip). This was a breeze to use! Even though it is a felt tip (I usually always choose brush tip) it wasn\u2019t hard nor did it hurt to use on my thin skin. It is relatively opaque but if you keep going over it while it is still wet, it will move around and look uneven, so I suggest working in layers and waiting for it to dry first. If you put too much however it can turn a bit dry and cracked looking but a bit of practice should avoid that! It didn\u2019t run at all because of water or sweat and it stayed put really really well. Overall I really recommend it! I\u2019ve used it a few times already and it hasn\u2019t disappointed me, it just needs a good shaking and it\u2019s ready to go.

      "This is so well done! I have a very similar eyelid shape so thank you for inspiring me to pick up my eyeliner again and play around :) Not gonna lie, I\u2019ve had major FOMO with graphic eyeliner in the last year, but every time I see a cool look that I\u2019d want to try I quickly realize it wouldn\u2019t do my eye shape any favors.

      "So WOW! Never thought I would have my photo posted up on Reddit. Especially in a beauty thread. Super awesome! Thank you all for all your support. The industry is certainly changing here. I remember when I first started modeling and working in Korea, no one had my color. Either I didn't get makeup or they would attempt to do some type of foundation... I would end up with some sort of ghost face or looking like Michael Jackson from Thriller. Most stores didn't have my shade. I remember when I was in Spain working for a bit I bought some foundation and concealer (Sephora )and learned to do makeup myself. (Sometimes there is no makeup artist.) But times have changed. Sephora opened up, Fenty Beauty launched, and even MAC started carrying our colors. These days when I when I go on shoots (If there is an makeup artist) they 9/10 have some product that is near my skin color. Usually MAC or something similar. But I also carry my own little makeup kit, just case. Easier to use something that was bought for my skin color rather then mixing up or down colors. But it awesome. Korean and other brands are recognizing that dark skin/ or people of color in general are markets that they should be involved in. Especially with the Korean-Wave being so popular these days. Many people want skincare product (which is generally universal to all skin colors) or to wear makeup like their favorite idols.

      "Ooh great cheat sheet!!! I'm only well versed in anti aging research and looks like you nailed it in that column!! By the way, you know how galactomyces are really common in AB products? As far as I've found, it's pretty much bullshit that it's an anti aging ingredient. But there's two *in vitro* studies I found. [This one](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ced.12635) says: >The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) recognizes diverse small molecules such as dioxins, tryptophan photoproducts and phytochemicals. It also plays crucial roles in epidermal homeostasis by upregulating epidermal barrier proteins. In preliminary screening, we found that Galactomyces fermentation filtrate (GFF), a cosmetic compound, was capable of activating AhR. In English, it translates to galactomyces *might* help our skin's moisture barrier. And [this one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5372886/) says: >The ROS production by TNF\u03b1 is markedly downregulated by the simultaneous addition of GFF and EGCG (TNF\u03b1 + GFF + EGCG). Which in English means that galactomyces + green tea work synergistically together to eliminate reactive oxygen species (i.e. free radicals), which are the things that cause photoaging due to UVA exposure. Look at Figure 5 of the study. It's pretty interesting how galactomyces and green tea together work better than either galactomyces or green tea alone!",
      "Hi friends, \u2063\u2063 \u2063\u2063 I put in a lot of effort to make this post. I put together a list of the 8 most common k-beauty skincare ingredients that I keep seeing over and over again. \u2063\u2063 I've done an in-depth research on all these ingredients and what I find is that, Niacinamide has the MOST amount of clinical evidence and results in human skin. \u2063Snail Mucin was the second on the list with the most amount of evidence available. However, the anti-aging effects are temporary because snail mucin just swells up wrinkles and fine lines. This effect may last for a day or so. \u2063\u2063 \u2063\u2063The rest of the ingredients have shown results mostly in a laboratory environment. These results cannot be extrapolated in human skin. \u2063\u2063 \u2063\u2063 However, it's possible that you may see other benefits in addition to hydration. Everyone's skin reacts differently! I hope this list is helpful :) \u2063\u2063 \u2063\u2063 Let me know if you have any questions or comments :)",
      "I've been thinking about adding niacinamide into my routine for about a year now, can anyone offer any tips on the best products and also the best time for application? Whereabouts in my routine should I include a niacinamide product? TIA <3",
      "Honestly I love K-beauty because my skin is mostly okay except I kept getting dry patches. K-beauty has hit the nail on the head with hydration. The hydrating products are also great accompaniment to any active use when I do feel like using AHA, BHA, Vit C, Retinol etc. The chart is slightly misleading as it\u2019s a random set of ingredients that are in no way exhaustive, so I don\u2019t necessarily agree with the bottom line.",
      "Also, licorice definitely has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects! Licochalcone A and glycyrrhetinic acid are probably the best studied licorice derivatives when it comes to anti-inflammatory benefit, and there are other studies looking at the general root extract also showing anti-inflammatory effect. The anti-inflammatory effect of glycyrrhetinic acid is theorized to exist because the chemical shares some structural similarities to cortisone. There are a number of licorice phytochemicals that have been determined to be antioxidants in vitro, too. Certainly licochalcone A (and the other chalcones) and also glabridin, which is also the component in licorice responsible for the skin lightening benefits. (Also, I *think* there is some evidence that green tea has skin brightening benefits, but I know less about green tea than I do about licorice. I just searched green tea + skin lightening + ncbi and a couple studies popped up! Not 100% sure though.)"

It looked like a milder version of your first pic - my right cheek esp was red with irritated dots all over. It took nearly a year of washing with oatmeal, using gentle oil free products, and light non scented creams to get my skin back. My skin is still dry and not perfect but seeing your progress gives me hope. Thank you for sharing!",
      "***Photos are of my bare skin under natural lighting.*** I discovered AB mid 2018 and was so excited at the prospect of finally getting rid of the CCs (closed comedomes) on my otherwise clear skin, that I dived head first into AHAs & BHAs. **BOY** was I in for a ride. After 1 week of using an assortment of AB products, mainly chemical exfoliaters, I saw a drastic improvement in the texture of my skin. No purge, just straight up smooth and soft like a baby's bum. Week 2, I started feeling a bit of discomfort and my skin was looking a tad shiny. No bother, just the products working their magic, getting that chokchok glow no doubt, no doubt. Coolcoolcool. **WRONG.** My skin went from fine with a few CCs --> super clear & soft --> dry, shiny & irritated --> full blown angry rash. The 1st photo was taken within 3 weeks of starting ~~an AB skincare routine~~ a mission to destroy my face. Fast forward to the 2nd photo which was taken yesterday, almost an entire year has passed. I'm IMMENSELY grateful to this community for saving my skin from myself. **Skin type:** Dry & Sensitive **Skin issues:** Texture **AM routine:** * Krave Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser * Kikumasamune High Moist Lotion / Missha Time Revolution First Treatment Essence * Skin1004 Madagascar Centella Asiatica Ampuole / CosRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence * Etude House Soon Jung 2x Barrier Intensive Cream * A'pieu Madecasscocide Sun Cream SPF39 PA++ **PM routine:** * Kose Softymo Deep Cleansing Oil * Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant (bi-weekly) * CosRX Low pH Good Morning Cleanser * Kikumasamune High Moist Lotion / Missha Time Revolution First Treatment Essence * Stratia Soft Touch AHA (bi-weekly) * Skin1004 Madagascar Centella Asiatica Ampuole / CosRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence * Klairs Rich Moist Soothing Cream / Laniege Water Sleeping Mask * Aritaum Ginger Sugar Overnight Lip Mask Spring has just started in Australia so I'll definitely be adding a stronger SPF to my routine. I also use sheet masks on occasion targetted at whatever issues I may be experiencing. I'm still learning! Any advice is most welcome. For newbies out there, research ingredients, spot test and be patient. It took me almost 8 months to fully recover from my ordeal and it was one of the most painful and embarrassing things I've ever experienced. At one point I wished I would've just left my skin alone, it wasn't even that problematic to begin with. AB works but for the love of snails don't ***LEEEEEEEEROY JENNNNNNKINS*** it like I did!",

      "One thing I have learned from trying out products is... Use one or two at a time... So if you'll have any allergic reactions you'll know which one is the culprit. I remember 2014 when I get a break out which never happened in my early 20's.. I have less pimples and they'll be gone for the next day. But in 2014, hell break loose and I got a cystic pimples on my cheeks that are so bad... Me who is trying to figure out what happens, just tried anything I can grab on... Which worsen my pimples. So my tip is if you are trying out try to use it alone for a time then try it with your other skin regime. Now, I still get pimples but I know what to do with them. AHA and BHA, I would only use them for a certain amount of time. Like 1 month, then I'll stop and continue with my basic routine. Then will do it again for another month. Never use AHA and BHA when you know you'll be out in the sunlight for so long. They will burn like hell. I have tried it once and I got serious sunburn even I used sunblock on my face.",

Products used: * Espoir Pro Tailer Foundation Be Glow Foundation in 23W Beige * Espoir Real Eye Palette in Apricot Me * Etude House Big Cover Skin Fit Pro Concealer in N03 Neutral Vanilla * Peripera Speedy Skinny Brows in Natural Brown * Laka Wild Brow Shaper * Missha Cotton Contour in Smoked Hazel * Bbia Last Highlighter in Cream Glass * Amuse Soft Cream Cheeks in Milk * Clio Rouge Lip Velvet in Ginger Vanilla * Clio Mad Matte Stain In Blushing Pink I used the shades *Shook, Apricot Hottie, Young & Rich, Kiddo, Reaction* from the *Espoir Apricot Me Palette* for my eye makeup. This palette is ADORABLE - it has really cute muted warm toned peachy/apricot shades. Great for everyday use and for Spring/Summer too! For blush, I used *Amuse Soft Cream Cheeks in Milk* as a base and then topped it off with *Apricot Hottie* from the same eyeshadow palette. I\u2019m wearing lash extensions (C-curl), so no mascara here. Also I\u2019ve been into more of a natural eye makeup these days, so no eyeliner either! I wanted to achieve \u201cfeathery, lifted brows\u201d and I used the *Laka brow gel* for that effect. It doesn\u2019t clump up as much as other gels I\u2019ve used before and holds really well.

      "What a timely discussion! I plan to go to a store in my city that sells luxury K beauty/skincare today. I love SK-II Pitera Essence. I usually buy it from Costco to help ease the painful cost. I've also used and loved Whoo's Hwanyu eye cream. I'm not currently using it but plan to repurchase it at some point, possibly today. As for non K beauty, I am pretty faithful to Skinceuticals CE Ferulic. I've tried other vitamin C serums, and I know some people say this formula isn't as impressive as it used to be, but it works incredibly well for me. AnteAge MD is another firm favorite. Their growth factor duo noticeably improved my skin. Everything I've listed has had a marked effect.",

      "Is it a dry heat or a humid place? Cos i found i need wildly separate routines for those weathers. I'd use the same makeup remover. But for a dryer climate, i'd go for a richer cleanser (maybe one that's not foaming), milky toner, thicker serum, and a lightweight creamy moisturiser. I might even double up on the serum. I'd focus on ceramides, prebiotics and fatty acids. For a more humid weather though, i'd go for a fresher cleanser (probably foaming), very liquidy clear toners (even sometimes more than one, layered), humectant serums, and gels instead of creams for moisturising. And i would double up on toners and gels. Also concentrate more on hyaluronic acid, glycerine and maybe urea (highly hygroscopic).",

I used this when my prescription triluma is retinizing and irritate particular problematic spot on my skin. Calming down inflamed area. - CNP Propolis Energy Ampoule Pad.

While on vacation I don\u2019t like to bring a bunch of liquids in glass bottles or liquids in general - so I bring all toner pads encased in Ziploc bags. Slap it on, lay down to relax; once the pads dry down I peel it away and slap on the next pads - all without getting out of bed.

You can\u2019t peel these in two like the skinfood ones, but they can tear very easily in halves without scissors if you like having smaller pieces to mask your forehead/nose/chin.

      "I have recently just tried a RF (radio frequency) facial & tbh the only reason I ended up doing it was because I always jump on any/all deals!! I never pay full price for facials, products, ect\u2026 so the deal was get 1 RF treatment for $199.00 & get it anywhere else on your body for free so I chose my face & abdomen. So now I officially have a membership because I seen such a huge difference on my stomach!!!! My face not as much but I think it\u2019s because I really didn\u2019t need it on my face but it did bring out my jawline a lot!!! They take before & after pics because they show you the difference that day\u2026 so I\u2019m actually going Sat & doing my stomach again & with the membership I can go once every mnth so I\u2019m going to alternate back & forth & do my abdomen then do what they call a butt lift. During my yr membership I might get my face done again but idk. But it must have done a whole lot of something for me to get a membership!! I\u2019m not even a member @ my spa\u2026 so I would highly recommend looking into a RF skin tightening facial. It\u2019s non surgical & it\u2019s completely painless.

      "Hey, so it sounds like it could possibly be subtype 1 or erythematotelangiectatic rosacea. Your description fits the redness, heat sensitivity, and flushing triggered by sun/heat. The fact that it calms with shade/cooling but feels tight also aligns. I think that some dermatologists hesitate to diagnose rosacea unless visible blood vessels, called telangiectasia, or persistent redness (not just flushing) are present. You mention your skin being relatively calm during both visits, which might explain why they dismissed it. As others have said, you might look into MCAS, too as some of the symptoms fit. Heat-triggered flushing, redness on neck/ears, and a burning sensation, specifically. I know you said your preferred derm diagnosed some kind of dermatitis. I can see why, especially if it\u2019s not just sun/heat but also sweat sunscreen, or environmental allergens, this could play a role. Neck/ear involvement suggests possible contact triggers. Another possibility would be a photosensitivity disorder. Some autoimmune conditions (like lupus) cause sun-induced redness, but this *usually* comes with other symptoms like rashes, and joint pain. Seeking yet another opinion might be best since you have nothing conclusive right now. Maybe a different dermatitis, preferably one specializing in rosacea or facial redness. If you're in a bit of a healthcare desert as I am, you could try your longstanding Dr but be prepared for the visit with photos and video of your skin during a flare. In the video, be sure to describe what it feels like. The smallest, often forgettable, detail can be what leads to a diagnosis. By cataloging your symptoms when it's happening, you ensure you don't forget anything. Once the Dr sees how bad it can be, they may decide to prescribe something. Common treatments include Brimonidine (Mirvaso) or oxymetazoline (Rhofade). Both of these are used to treat flushing but these can cause rebound redness so they are only prescribed when absolutely necessary. An oral anti-inflammatory like low-dose doxycycline might be used if it\u2019s stubborn. If your doctor still isn't confident in their diagnosis, even with the additional information you'll be prepared to provide, I would suggest asking about patch testing to rule out contact allergies. I'm a big fan of Azelaic Acid and have found it helpful for my own rosacea treatment. I wouldn't bother with cosmetic formulations as they typically contain 10% or less or even AzA derivatives which have less data supporting their effectiveness. Prescriptions are available in either 15% or 20% and I have found both to be helpful though I prefer the texture of the 15%. I would hold off on an online derm since you're planning to see one in person again soon. I would also hold off on IPL, at least until you know more and your skin is consistently calmer. It can help redness and flushing, but it\u2019s best done when skin isn\u2019t super reactive. As another commenter shared, bad settings can worsen things. Until, you know more, you might try keeping a thermal water spray (Avene, La Roche-Posay) in the fridge for flare-ups to help with cooling. A cica-based moisturizer/barrier support treatment (Avene Cicalfate, LRP Cicaplast) to combat tightness and over time, lessen reactivity. I'd also suggest rechecking your sunscreen because even mineral SPF can irritate. If you're using a zinc oxide + titanium dioxide mix, you might tolerate tinted SPF (iron oxides block more visible light). I certainly hope your derm is willing to revisit the issue and does so thoroughly but If they/other derms keep dismissing it, you could explore a rheumatologist or an allergist to rule out systemic causes. Hope this helps and that you soon have more answers than you currently do. I know all too well how frustrating it is to have to chase a diagnosis. xx",
      "Hey there. I have very similar skin to yours. Standard rosacea treatments have never helped me. BUT my derm prescribed me Oxymetazoline cream and it basically clears the redness altogether. It's a medicine that constricts blood vessels. It does not 'fix' the issue but it sure helps me feel normal on a daily basis. Outside of topicals, my derm prescribed me very low dose beta blockers which help significantly with flushing. Between these two options Im feeling pretty well managed.

The only real way to soften water is with a softener, which removes the minerals causing hardness. If your budget is around a few dozen dollars, you can try a shower filter to remove chlorine. It might help. If you have around 200 dollars to spend, take a look at SoftWaterCare. It installs before the showerhead and includes both a filter and a softener, so it can remove chlorine and also soften the water. That usually works better.

      "Totally fair questions \u2014 Sculptra is one of those treatments that gets lumped in with \"fillers,\" but it's actually pretty different. Sculptra isn\u2019t a filler in the traditional sense \u2014 it doesn\u2019t just \u201cfill\u201d an area like hyaluronic acid-based products (like Juvederm or Restylane) do. It\u2019s made of poly-L-lactic acid, and what it does is stimulate your body to produce its own collagen over time. So instead of instantly plumping the area, it works gradually over a few months, and the results tend to look very natural. Does it stay forever or migrate? Nope \u2014 it doesn\u2019t stick around like some permanent fillers. It breaks down naturally over time as your body creates new collagen. And because it spreads in a more diffuse way, it\u2019s less prone to lumping or migrating when injected properly (i.e. no 'duck lips'). But technique really matters \u2014 this is definitely a \u201cgo to someone who knows what they\u2019re doing\u201d kind of treatment. Is it effective? Yes \u2014 for the right person. It works best for people who want to fix volume loss gradually (especially in the cheeks, temples, jawline). It\u2019s also great if you\u2019re looking for something that builds over time rather than looks like a sudden change. Most people need a few sessions spaced out over months to see the full effect. Any downsides? It\u2019s not immediate \u2014 so if you want a quick fix, this isn\u2019t it. And again, it\u2019s technique-sensitive, so you really want an experienced injector who understands how to layer and space out treatments. Hope this helps clear it up a bit \u2014 it\u2019s definitely not a one-size-fits-all treatment, but for the right person, it can be a game-changer.",
      "I am 56- had one vial done 6 months ago in my temples and a little around my mouth. Very happy with it. Subtle but definitely noticed an improvement especially in photos. Less shadowing around my mouth and an overall smoother more youthful look. Have had zero issues with it. I think it was about $700 and was done by a board certified derm. I originally went in for filler but the doctor suggested we try Sculptra instead. Have gone to her for 10 years and trust her implicitly so was confident in her suggestion. Extremely hapoy overall.",
      "I had three vials injected in early 2023. I had volume loss/asymmetry and it did a great job correcting it. I had it injected in the apical triangle to correct nasolabial folds, cheeks, jawline, and temples. The results are very gradual, so definitely not an instant gratification situation. Each session was about two months apart, and it took approximately one year to see full results. They recommend touchups once a year, but I am going in this year at some point for my first touchup. I was 37 when I had it done, and my injector said results would be more optimal starting earlier rather than waiting for more advanced signs of aging as it takes more product to get good results. I followed all the standard aftercare instructions and had no complications. The injections are more painful than regular facial filler or Botox because they are deeper, but it does contain a numbing agent. I would say it is no where near as painful as lip filler without anesthesic. I did not want to erase all signs of aging or have an extreme or jarring result, and feel it did a great job helping restore lost volume. I feel like I look more like myself before I experienced volume loss.",

The hydrocolloid bandage soaks up all the oil that the pores excrete over night (just like the pimple patches do) and my sebaceous filaments are looking MUCH smaller and less congested since I started about two weeks ago. I got a pack of 20 wound bandages from Walmart (the big 4x4 square kind) and have been cutting them up until they\u2019re roughly the size of a regular pore strip. I put them on overnight after finishing the rest of my skincare and take them off when I wake up in the morning. Sometimes I can leave your skin a little dry/flaky in the morning so be sure to exfoliate afterwards and use a good daytime moisturizer. Hopefully you can give this method a shot to see if it works for you.",
      "Sebaceous filaments are a normal part of skin function and can never be permanently removed, but consistent gentle exfoliation with a focus on hydration, plus using a good clay mask occasionally, can help minimize their appearance without damaging your skin barrier. If they're visibly protruding, you might want to review your moisturizer or makeup formulas to ensure they're not contributing to congestion.",
      "I just told my friend I\u2019ve had 2 big breakthroughs with my SF\u2019s recently. DDG Peel Pads (Alpha Beta IIRC) and Byoma\u2019s Moisturizing Gel Sunscreen SPF 30. The Byoma is very new so it\u2019s still being tested. I LOVE the finish alone excluding its apparent impact on my SF, so I\u2019ve already repurchased it. Had SFs for over 20 years. Mine are much smaller now. I\u2019m so thrilled. DDG peels are my only expensive-to-me-item in my routine & find them very worth it. I can use half a peel every two weeks which is wild. If you try the DDG peels, definitely cut them in half and clip the package shut.",
      "I swear by pore strips. I wash my face and soften the skin and use them after a shower every 2 weeks or so. My skin has never reacted poorly to biore pore strips nor does it hurt me. I can see the filaments being pulled out and it\u2019s satisfying. I feel cleaner and you can immediately see a difference. Makeup goes on better, skin feels better. I do notice it\u2019s worse when I wear makeup so I almost never wear foundation. The only other thing that\u2019s worked for me was accutane which is hard to get if you don\u2019t have active acne. I need to figure out how to get back on it.",
      "Don\u2019t do it!! I ended up with burst capillaries that would have been so preventable. Not worth it!! EDIT to add besides oil cleanse and chemical exfoliation, a good clay mask helps with the satisfaction side of picking them for me. You can really feel the oil get drawn up and washed away. I like the Origins charcoal mask and I only use it on my nose where I used to use nose strips."

      "The reality is no topical product or makeup technique will help this. It is volume loss and your only options are filler or facial fat transfer (which can be done with or without a lower bleph). I've been getting filler for ~5 years and LOVE the results, it looks completely natural and just makes me look much more refreshed. I get one vial split between both eyes and that's perfect for me. However at this point, as the skin under my eyes is also getting crepey and aging, I'm going to stop getting filler and just save that money for the fat transfer/lower bleph in a few years. I actually really hate stopping filler because I forgot how bad the hollows get without it, but I know fat transfer is the better long-term/more permanent choice. If you opt for the filler route just go to an experienced injector with a really good reputation. My med spa focuses on \"natural look\" and will actually turn your money down and talk you out of procedures that aren't right for you, so I know I'll never end up overfilled there. And the whole staff is highly experienced and specialized in one thing- like a person for Botox, a person for IPL, a person for ablative laser, etc- so you're not getting someone who only does filler once a year. There's a lot of fearmongering about filler but if injected by someone who knows that they're doing, in the right amounts at the right depth in the right areas, it's incredible. Fat transfer has its own problems as well. It can be a lot more dangerous- filler is injected by cannula so can't pierce a blood vessel or anything, while fat transfer generally will be injected with a needle. The fat doesn't always \"take\" and you may end up with no results or uneven results. If you don't like how it looks, it's permanent, it won't dissolve in 6 months. So, it's not something to be done lightly and you absolutely want to research the shit out of it and find a great surgeon if you choose to go that route. Might want to start with filler and see how you like it before opting for the permanent version.",

      "I am so sorry you are going through all of this. I have a horrible trifector of skin conditions: rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis, and acne that is vitamin B sensitive. It has taken a long time to figure out what to avoid. It might help your skin if you avoid triggers for these. Oils especially can be a problem as you well know. While it has become trendy, that doesn't negate the usefulness of MCT oil, or medium chain triglycerides. They also go by \"capric / caprylic triglycerides\" or such on ingredients labels. MCT oil can safely be used for oil cleansing. It is non-triggering because it helps balance your skin microbiome. MCT oil does not feed any of the organisms that trigger issues. Most oil cleansers use olive oil or similar for the base and they are some of the most triggering oils there are, as you have found. It is a feast for certain organisms and can throw skin out of balance. After this experience, I don't blame you if you never want to try oil cleansing again. Maybe start with a patch test of MCT oil and go from there? It might be useful as a safe moisturizer for you, even if you don't end up using it for oil cleansing. It's reasonably priced, you won't spend more than $20 and prob less for a big bottle that will last a long time, probably a year. I even use it on my scalp as a pre-wash treatment and sparingly on the lengths/ends of my dry hair to smooth frizz. Just extra ideas for you to use up the bottle of oil. BTW, niacinamide triggers ance for me but it takes about 10 days of use to start showing up. You may want to test if it is also a trigger for your acne. It has become popular lately and is showing up in many products. In the meanwhile, you may want to try some salicylic acid to help clear your pores. Most acne care products can be drying and the MCT oil can help counter that.",

Or, you might just be super sensitive to any level of oxidation in oils- my skin tends to be like that.",

I also use just plain organic hemp seed oil which I've read is very close in composition to your skins natural oil, so it's not irritating.",

All of them resulted with the same thing; cystic acne and white heads. No matter what I did, this was always the result. I got rid of oil cleansing and now rely on BHA to remove my filaments.

      "Some great responses to this already so I won't repeat what others have said. What I will add is that I think it can be helpful to think of those cells, not as \"dead cells\" but as mature cells. Even as they come to the end of the cycle (and become the outer most layer, the SC), they're still providing an important function i.e. as your skin barrier. When we overdo exfoliation, we are essentially removing too much of that barrier which leads to disruption - irritation etc. Exfoliation should be used to help shift any excess of skin cells (which you'll see in the form of dullness / flakiness), but extra attention should also be given to keeping your skin well hydrated (as this allows the skin to naturally exfoliate). This process slows with age (which is why we often find we need to exfoliate a little more than when we're younger), or when the skin is very oily (as this also disrupts the exfoliation process). So make sure you choose an exfoliator that addresses your particular needs (considering if your skin is sensitive or tolerant, leans drier or oilier), and also think about the strength and frequency of use. I personally feel that for most people with healthy skin, daily exfoliation isn't necessary (contrary to what brands tell you). Someone with really oily skin will get away with more frequent exfoliation.",
      "I actually do short contact with acids. I leave them on for about 30 minutes and wash them off. My skin is pretty sensitive to stronger acids, so this works best for me. So, I get why you ask, and I say if you want to use them this way, you can. Exfoliants begin exfoliating the moment they make contact with the skin. After about 30 minutes, they\u2019ve done their job. No need to leave them on unless the product has other beneficial ingredients in it. The exception would be mild exfoliants like gluconolactone, which do take a bit longer to work.",
      "What kind of exfoliating?!?! Glycolic and other AHAs loosen the bonds in your outermost layer of skin. This helps speed up your natural skin shedding process, resulting in a smoother layer of skin.",

      "\u201cWhy don\u2019t people was off acids.\u201d The truth is, some people do! If your skin is very sensitive to physical or chemical exfoliation (mine is), you can absolutely ease into it by washing your face after 5 minutes."

      "You are picturing an instant process, and it isn't instant. That's all. These milder acids don't dissolve EVERYTHING in any way, or you'd be acid-bathing your face with something like HCL. They loosen up the \"glue\", as it's usually called (reality: lipids and proteins), holding the matrix of dead skin cells in place, letting those dead cells shed efficiently and effectivly instead of whenever the heck they want. They work loose and drop away over the hours/days later- at the cellular size level, so it's not like you'll SEE some big hunk of flesh parking there. Really, you're cleaning up the last of the dead cells any time you dust, hoover, or run a roomba. Also remember that the outer few levels of skin are dead (by design) as an extra protective measure. With exfoliating, you're keeping that layer sleek and functional instead of it over-building due to slow shedding. But there's still always a dead layer ready to shine through behind it, which is what exfoliating is bringing to the surface. This above is why deep peels are a) a thing and b) not equatable to our exfoliating toners or serums. They're stronger, go deeper, and take off a lot more of the \"dead\" layer. With toners, serums, anything you can use multiple times a week, it's a mild and slower process. In short, the gunk and goop is there, but it's not coming off in 0.3 seconds like with a strong/real acid. It's floating off a cell or a goop-pinprick at a time, so you don't notice it.",
      "Glycolic acid penetrates the skin on application and helps to promote skin turnover and natural skin shedding, ensuring dead skin cells are sloughed off during your usual daily life (which occurs naturally as part of existing, but acid helps with speed and efficiency). At the end of the day, or whenever you wash your face, you are washing off those dead skin cells. So essentially, you would wash your face at some point and remove any dead skin cells that haven't already come off during your regular day of moving about the world",
      "That typo \ud83d\ude02 Hope no one is doing \u201cantisemitic exfoliating.\u201d As for your question, glycolic acid is a chemical exfoliant, which means it works by breaking down the \u201cglue\u201d that holds dead skin cells together on the surface of your skin. It doesn\u2019t make dead skin vanish into vapor, it just loosens those cells so they can be removed more easily. So yes, if you\u2019re using something like a glycolic acid cleanser or mask, you rinse it off, and it physically takes the loosened dead skin with it. But if you\u2019re using a leave-on product like a toner, serum, or lotion, you don\u2019t rinse. In that case, the exfoliation happens more gradually, and the dead skin cells just shed naturally over time."

When I followed up, the clinic explained that some practitioners are very by-the-book and will only treat the exact concern you\u2019re booked in for unless it's pre-cleared. She wasn\u2019t being shady, just more conservative, especially since TMJ dosing can vary based on muscle size, strength, and how reactive your body is to Botox. That said, if you paid for 50 units, you *should absolutely* get all 50 \u2014 or at the very least, have a clear explanation as to why they weren\u2019t used. Whether it\u2019s refunded, banked for later, or used cosmetically like you\u2019re used to, there should be transparency. It\u2019s your face, and your money.

      "My dad had various versions and severities of skin cancer for decades. He was light skinned (so am I) and went bald very young. 90% or more of the cancers were on his head, ears, and neck. The last surgery he had was a lump on the top of his head. He had Mohs surgery and they had to remove a LOT of tissue to get it all. He had a skin graft from his thigh plus they had to do an extensive \"spiral\" incision to create a flap to cover the huge wound. They left the site open for a few weeks. He was living with me and I did wound care for months before it healed. I took lots of progress pictures but they'd DEFINITELY be NSFW. My neighbor and her daughters lay out in the sun all summer. I've been tempted many, many times to walk over there and share the pictures with them. I'm as white as they come and am covered in freckles from several severe sunburns as a child (I was born in 1965). I don't remember sunscreen being put on me which clearly explains the current state of my skin. My parents just told me to play in the shade. Luckily my ex has a natural dark/olive skin tone and 2 of my 4 inherited it. One of my other kids is super white like me, and the oldest is not as white as me and her father (different guy) has an average Caucasian skin tone. She has been losing pigment all over her body for a few years now and I'm sure it's vitiligo. Point being... Check your skin regularly. All of it.",

It's not dark!\", but if anything it made me worry even more lol. Doesn't help that we only have two derms around with one of them being an absolute unhelpful asshole with my parents, so I'd prefer to go to the other one. But from what I've seen they're also fully booked until next year. Derms in larger cities a bit away from me aren't any better at giving out appointments sadly.

      "So glad you went and it was caught. These things can look so innocent. My father died of melanoma at a relatively young age so I am very aware of the things to look for with moles but it had never occurred to me to learn about what to look for with other skin cancer types. I go to the derm annually for a skin check due to family history and just went on Friday. I mentioned to her that I had a tiny little dry spot on my face that didn't seem to be going away with moisturizer. I expected her to recommend a different moisturizer. Instead she looked at it and said it was very likely a BCC and biopsied it. She felt confident enough that it would come back positive that she went ahead and made me the appointment for removal and said we'd cancel it if the biopsy was negative. I've since googled pictures of BCC and SCC and so many of the pictures look so much more dramatic and abnormal than what I had. It is scary to think many people won't have these things checked because they expect cancer to either come from moles, or to look really abnormal. Mine was smaller than the diameter of a pea. It just looked like irritated dry skin, but it wasn't healing."

She probably has an amazing routine, wish she could start a beauty and skincare/lifestyle channel !",
      "Everyone should know that she got a VERY good facelift before she went no (read: minimal) makeup. So the average woman shouldn\u2019t feel bad about herself that she doesn\u2019t look like this without makeup at Pamela\u2019s age. Edit: I\u2019m not getting into an argument in the replies as to whether she got it or not. If you\u2019ve seen enough good facelifts you can start spotting them instantly. You start getting an eye for them. Most scars will be hidden in and past her hairlines but you can see tell tale signs around her ears in particular. I completely agree with other replies that she\u2019s also had other work done too like a blepharoplasty. It\u2019s literally impossible for her to have this level of tautness in her facial and neck skin at her age with her admitted lack of sunscreen and sun exposure in her youth. The key is that I\u2019m talking about a very good facelift. Like Dr Catherine Chang in Beverly Hills and her ilk good. Go check out her instagram if you want to see what insanely good work looks like these days. Or take a look at what Demi Moore or Brad Pitt look like in 2024 as they\u2019ve just had this level of facelift (but with different surgeons and it wasn\u2019t their first facelifts either). Those facelifts are USD 250,000-400,000+ good. I wouldn\u2019t be remotely surprised if Pamela\u2019s facelift cost half a mil especially with the other work she got done for a full facial rejuvenation. Edit 2: Another commenter rightly pointed out that she\u2019s even wearing mascara and eyeliner in this photo so she\u2019s not even bare faced in this photo. None of this is to shame her by the way, it\u2019s just really disingenuous for her to claim she\u2019s \u2018all natural and no makeup\u2019 when she\u2019s had extensive work done and wears makeup anyway, just minimally and strategically.",

But WHY do people see social media photos and fall hook line and sinker into assuming they are reality? \ud83d\ude06 Most people's phones have an auto-tune feature that slightly tweaks pics to look just a tiny bit better.

If you search for Rihanna\u2019s performance at a recent carnival-type event she did you can find real unedited photos. You can see her pores, her false lashes with a little too much glue or eyeliner, a tiny bulge of armpit fat like any woman has. Sorry for the rant but I see posts here every day where people are so impressed by perfect looking photos (sometimes they are selfies which is a whole other issue\u2026 some self reflection is in order if you edit selfies to post to a skincare board as real!) where women have no skin texture, not a single hint of an old blemish or under eye darkness.

      "What!? That\u2019s pretty crazy. Your post just made me go check my product, and it\u2019s totally normal. (But I have the 50 ml version). I have to say I\u2019m in love with this product. One of the best I\u2019ve used in a long time, making noticeable positive differences in my skin. I\u2019m sorry it feels like they ripped you off!",
      "Honestly, size and product quality aside, this looks like a really sanitary way of dispensing product with Zero chance of oxidation or airborne contaminants entering the bottles during production/manufacturing. I\u2019m quite impressed that packaging like this is now possible and helps boost confidence that no product even could be left in the container. (Obviously a pain point/frustration factor, trying to dig the extra bits out). Helpful to know tho, always read the volume markings to understand how much is actually in the container. Very helpful post \ud83d\ude4f",
      "I'm sorry but I laughed way too hard at this!! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",
      "But does it really have 15ml in that little condom?\ud83e\udd14 Edit: Okay okay everybody's telling me what 15ml exactly is. AND this is my first comment on Reddit that got more than 800 likes yay",
      "I thought Good Genes was a holy grail after I used a full bottle and my skin was amazing. So many compliments. I mimicked that regimen again two years later and nope, it wasn\u2019t GG. The difference is I\u2019m not using Skin Food and a ceramide serum called Buffet by TO. I\u2019m gonna buy both of those and reintroduce them separately. Luckily I didn\u2019t spend much on this bottle of GG."

      "They sell this in a 15ml, 30ml, and 50ml. They sell it in this type of packaging for multiple reasons. First, it\u2019s easier to recycle, so better for the environment. Second, you can actually get the most out of the product by removing the bag and cutting it open if you\u2019d like. It\u2019s also more hygienic and lasts longer in this packaging. Products like this cost more for a reason. Stop hating just to hate because you want to pay less or you saw something on TikTok once that a 13 year old said that upset you about a brand. PS I have no hat in the Sunday Riley arena. I\u2019m just tired of people hating on good brands because they don\u2019t do actual research.",

      "I went out and bought this yesterday after seeing your post the night before and wow! It was exactly what I needed. I had tried retinol creams which dried my face out more, other anti aging creams, different hydrating lotions, but nothing worked like the Gold Bond has! I used it exactly like you did and while I don\u2019t have any crepe skin I do have dry skin and some fine lines that I notice don\u2019t go away after smiling ect. But.. the cream plumped my skin right up! I didn\u2019t think about a before and after but this was totally worth it and a super affordable price point. I\u2019m sure like past posters said, it\u2019s not going to work magic on your skin unless you have hydration issues but for me it was exactly what I needed. My face is so soft! \u263a\ufe0f",

      "THANK YOU for posting this! I am 37 years old and noticed my necklace lines becoming really deep, to the point they were all I could see in pictures. I would run my fingers done my neck and could physically feel the indentations. I figured I just had to learn to love them or get filler, and I really didn't want to go the filler route. I have used this morning & night for 3 days and I WISH I took before and after pictures. My necklace lines aren't, gone but they're significantly better. I ran my fingers down my neck to see if I was imagining things and the indentations are absolutely more shallow. I don't know why or how this works but it's really cool to see an affordable product boast results like this."

Your crepe looks slightly red on top of being dry and flaky, could you maybe have eczema? Or even product induced eczema from using a retinoid or anti-aging product on that area? I believe you when you say its from the weight loss but the redness and flakiness make me wonder if theres more to the story, especially since loose skin from weight loss doesn\u2019t typically tighten up that fast",

My mom surprised me with three sessions for my birthday one year, considering I was the only one in my family who has ever had acne and she knew how much it was affecting my confidence. I only had two of the three sessions due to moving different states before getting the third, and like you, it genuinely changed my entire life!!! I don\u2019t need to wear face makeup anymore and no longer have hyperpigmentation. I have some residual scarring, but it\u2019s clustered and shallow enough that you can only tell it\u2019s there if you\u2019re looking at my skin under certain lighting.

      "I think that when you first see the signs of aging, it\u2019s bloody terrifying. When I was 21 I had a full baby face and I couldn\u2019t go anywhere without men, commenting or staring at me when I turned 22 I began to lose the volume in my face and take on the more mature look that I would have as a woman instead of a girl at the time, I didn\u2019t understand it. I called all kinds of plastic surgeons. There was NOTHING for volume loss. I\u2019m almost 61 now and feel younger but also accept that I\u2019m an older woman. I can look pretty in good light when I am fixed up but I rarely get attention from men. They compliment me online, but I use light filters. I used to work at a pharmaceutical company and the last department that I worked in was immunology. I was once talking to a male Chinese immunologist who everyone respected and he told me that the number one way to keep yourself healthy and to stop the aging process or slow. It was to get enough sleep , he couldn\u2019t emphasize how important that was. Eight hours of good solid sleep if you can get it. The other things that I do are from extensive research and I do believe they\u2019ve helped. Number one is tretinoin ( Retin A). Please purchase the real thing from a dermatologist. You can also get it online from an online doctor. The amount of Trenten in Rinna is so much higher than the drugstore or beauty counter brands that it\u2019s crazy use it a lot. I use it 3 to 4 times a week. It\u2019s incredibly drying at first so go slowly with any year you should be able to handle it. I use topical estrogen the other night that\u2019s a new thing for me that I just started doing, but boy does it work! Musely is a company I recommend. The other thing I swear by is castor oil. Put it on your face on the nights that you don\u2019t use tretinoin or space it 45 minutes after the tread no one has dried put it everywhere including in your hair. It helps your hair grow and it\u2019s a godsend for your skin, you can use almond oil but castor oil is really the gold standard. Put it on your face your neck, your decay. The back of your hands I have had fat grafting done to my face that has created cheekbones. I had this done 20 years ago and it\u2019s still there, it took a long time for me to look like myself because they overfilled me and I looked like a chipmunk for a while. Now dermatologist have gotten very good at adding facial filler. I have not tried it, but if you go to someone for this, make sure that they are artistic and well-versed in the angles and planes of the face. Don\u2019t tan. I have tanned but I try not to. Last year I had three session of Radiofrequency microneedling on my neck and lower face. This tightens those areas, but you will lose volume. I also had three sessions with lasers. To my d\u00e9collet\u00e9. I also get botox ideally every 4 months. I\u2019ve slacked off on this bcuz i recently lost someone who was important to me and due to the sadness, I\u2019ve been moping around. Sleeping more. You are young and lovely but I do understand your concerns because you are evaluating yourself as only you can. It\u2019s your face. To us we see a young beauty.

      "I think we live in a time where women can just dress and be who they want. Some women love glamour and some love natural. Neither women should be put down for their style. I am seeing the opposite happening. If certain big stars are dressing down in their appearance they get rewarded with compliments. If others get plastic surgery or doll up or have previously dolled it up\u2026they get a lot of criticism. It seems they get patted on the back the more plain they look. There\u2019s a big star right now getting praised for looking dowdier for not wearing makeup at glamorous events. The dowdier some of these stars look right now the louder the applause. I personally like the glamour at big events. That\u2019s part of the sparkle and charisma of their star power. It\u2019s almost like they are being put down for being glamorous.i think doing a little something with one self always looks better. Especially blush! Being all washed out isn\u2019t pretty. I also saw a woman with long gray hair that made her look older and plain. But other women looked ok like that. Each individual is different. Some look good gray and without makeup and others don\u2019t. It\u2019s a time to do what you want. Don\u2019t put down a woman if she chooses to color her hair, wants plastic surgery, loves makeup or wants to be barefaced. Everyone can have their own style nowadays. That being said everyone can have their own opinion on it. There is no set right way or wrong way. Anything goes now a days. I personally like some makeup and effort put into my looks. But I will be the first to admit- when I don\u2019t feel good or am in a hurry - it\u2019s barefaced & wash out I go! \ud83d\ude02",

But someone posting to say it\u2019s great to have some visible women / celebrities who are beautiful but have many classic signs of aging gets attacked and taken as an insult? I mean- for those women and girls who are not interested in chasing a youthful image as they age- it IS very helpful to see examples of beautiful famous women who have what many consider \u201cflaws\u201d and are still beautiful and famous. It\u2019s not common among the celebrity set, and it does help to normalize the aging as still being beautiful. Like the OP didn\u2019t mention plastic surgery. Or attack anyone for getting it. She simply said we need to see more beautiful aging women who have the signs of aging because that visibility is important.",

Perhaps they are rare in the show business, but would be nice to see more of. Because regular women in this age bracket start to have lines, laxity, pre-jowls and tear troughs. It would make us feel less alone. Also, no-one, not even in the 60+ Hollywood gooddessess seem to have a double chin or jowling. is it so that only people with beautiful facial structure and skin laxity genes dare to \"embrace aging naturally\"? Or is something in their diet, excercise or lifestyle contributing to this?

She ate a truly massive amount of meat and cheese, was way overweight, and had no skincare routine whatsoever other than a wet washcloth with bar soap. She was a sun worshipper and sat in the sun every chance she got, with not a drop of sunscreen on. She wore as little clothes as possible when she did too, literally cooking her skin.

Her best plan to deal with all those problems was to sit in the sun more and drink more wine. Great idea. She died in her 60\u2019s. The youngest of the three? Her husband dragged her into a gang after she was married. They did a massive amount of drugs, chain smoked and drank from the time she got up till the time she went to bed. She looked 90 by the time she was 35. Eventually they left the gang, she eventually left the husband. She eventually quit the drugs, but never quit the haaaaard drinking. She also died in her 60\u2019s. BUT\u2026. The middle of the three always took care of herself. Diet, exercise, she covered her face, arms, and legs at the beach. She used good quality skincare products and rarely colored her hair. If she did, it was professionally done and top quality. She became a vegetarian shortly after she had her two kids. She rarely had any alcohol, and if she did it was only a glass of wine. She is still alive today at 80 something years old, still fit and trim, and still very healthy. Not a spot on her face.

      "Hey, so it sounds like it could possibly be subtype 1 or erythematotelangiectatic rosacea. Your description fits the redness, heat sensitivity, and flushing triggered by sun/heat. The fact that it calms with shade/cooling but feels tight also aligns. I think that some dermatologists hesitate to diagnose rosacea unless visible blood vessels, called telangiectasia, or persistent redness (not just flushing) are present. You mention your skin being relatively calm during both visits, which might explain why they dismissed it. As others have said, you might look into MCAS, too as some of the symptoms fit. Heat-triggered flushing, redness on neck/ears, and a burning sensation, specifically. I know you said your preferred derm diagnosed some kind of dermatitis. I can see why, especially if it\u2019s not just sun/heat but also sweat sunscreen, or environmental allergens, this could play a role. Neck/ear involvement suggests possible contact triggers. Another possibility would be a photosensitivity disorder. Some autoimmune conditions (like lupus) cause sun-induced redness, but this *usually* comes with other symptoms like rashes, and joint pain. Seeking yet another opinion might be best since you have nothing conclusive right now. Maybe a different dermatitis, preferably one specializing in rosacea or facial redness. If you're in a bit of a healthcare desert as I am, you could try your longstanding Dr but be prepared for the visit with photos and video of your skin during a flare. In the video, be sure to describe what it feels like. The smallest, often forgettable, detail can be what leads to a diagnosis. By cataloging your symptoms when it's happening, you ensure you don't forget anything. Once the Dr sees how bad it can be, they may decide to prescribe something. Common treatments include Brimonidine (Mirvaso) or oxymetazoline (Rhofade). Both of these are used to treat flushing but these can cause rebound redness so they are only prescribed when absolutely necessary. An oral anti-inflammatory like low-dose doxycycline might be used if it\u2019s stubborn. If your doctor still isn't confident in their diagnosis, even with the additional information you'll be prepared to provide, I would suggest asking about patch testing to rule out contact allergies. I'm a big fan of Azelaic Acid and have found it helpful for my own rosacea treatment. I wouldn't bother with cosmetic formulations as they typically contain 10% or less or even AzA derivatives which have less data supporting their effectiveness. Prescriptions are available in either 15% or 20% and I have found both to be helpful though I prefer the texture of the 15%. I would hold off on an online derm since you're planning to see one in person again soon. I would also hold off on IPL, at least until you know more and your skin is consistently calmer. It can help redness and flushing, but it\u2019s best done when skin isn\u2019t super reactive. As another commenter shared, bad settings can worsen things. Until, you know more, you might try keeping a thermal water spray (Avene, La Roche-Posay) in the fridge for flare-ups to help with cooling. A cica-based moisturizer/barrier support treatment (Avene Cicalfate, LRP Cicaplast) to combat tightness and over time, lessen reactivity. I'd also suggest rechecking your sunscreen because even mineral SPF can irritate. If you're using a zinc oxide + titanium dioxide mix, you might tolerate tinted SPF (iron oxides block more visible light). I certainly hope your derm is willing to revisit the issue and does so thoroughly but If they/other derms keep dismissing it, you could explore a rheumatologist or an allergist to rule out systemic causes. Hope this helps and that you soon have more answers than you currently do. I know all too well how frustrating it is to have to chase a diagnosis. xx",
      "Hey there. I have very similar skin to yours. Standard rosacea treatments have never helped me. BUT my derm prescribed me Oxymetazoline cream and it basically clears the redness altogether. It's a medicine that constricts blood vessels. It does not 'fix' the issue but it sure helps me feel normal on a daily basis. Outside of topicals, my derm prescribed me very low dose beta blockers which help significantly with flushing. Between these two options Im feeling pretty well managed. Btw, you can get a prescription for the oxymetazoline cream from online providers such as musely.",

I was so relieved when I got the rosacea diagnosis, because that meant I could \u201cfix it\u201d, but I was very wrong.

      "The reality is no topical product or makeup technique will help this. It is volume loss and your only options are filler or facial fat transfer (which can be done with or without a lower bleph). I've been getting filler for ~5 years and LOVE the results, it looks completely natural and just makes me look much more refreshed. I get one vial split between both eyes and that's perfect for me. However at this point, as the skin under my eyes is also getting crepey and aging, I'm going to stop getting filler and just save that money for the fat transfer/lower bleph in a few years. I actually really hate stopping filler because I forgot how bad the hollows get without it, but I know fat transfer is the better long-term/more permanent choice. If you opt for the filler route just go to an experienced injector with a really good reputation. My med spa focuses on \"natural look\" and will actually turn your money down and talk you out of procedures that aren't right for you, so I know I'll never end up overfilled there. And the whole staff is highly experienced and specialized in one thing- like a person for Botox, a person for IPL, a person for ablative laser, etc- so you're not getting someone who only does filler once a year. There's a lot of fearmongering about filler but if injected by someone who knows that they're doing, in the right amounts at the right depth in the right areas, it's incredible. Fat transfer has its own problems as well. It can be a lot more dangerous- filler is injected by cannula so can't pierce a blood vessel or anything, while fat transfer generally will be injected with a needle. The fat doesn't always \"take\" and you may end up with no results or uneven results. If you don't like how it looks, it's permanent, it won't dissolve in 6 months. So, it's not something to be done lightly and you absolutely want to research the shit out of it and find a great surgeon if you choose to go that route. Might want to start with filler and see how you like it before opting for the permanent version.",

The only real way to soften water is with a softener, which removes the minerals causing hardness. If your budget is around a few dozen dollars, you can try a shower filter to remove chlorine. It might help. If you have around 200 dollars to spend, take a look at SoftWaterCare. It installs before the showerhead and includes both a filter and a softener, so it can remove chlorine and also soften the water. That usually works better.

      "Totally fair questions \u2014 Sculptra is one of those treatments that gets lumped in with \"fillers,\" but it's actually pretty different. Sculptra isn\u2019t a filler in the traditional sense \u2014 it doesn\u2019t just \u201cfill\u201d an area like hyaluronic acid-based products (like Juvederm or Restylane) do. It\u2019s made of poly-L-lactic acid, and what it does is stimulate your body to produce its own collagen over time. So instead of instantly plumping the area, it works gradually over a few months, and the results tend to look very natural. Does it stay forever or migrate? Nope \u2014 it doesn\u2019t stick around like some permanent fillers. It breaks down naturally over time as your body creates new collagen. And because it spreads in a more diffuse way, it\u2019s less prone to lumping or migrating when injected properly (i.e. no 'duck lips'). But technique really matters \u2014 this is definitely a \u201cgo to someone who knows what they\u2019re doing\u201d kind of treatment. Is it effective? Yes \u2014 for the right person. It works best for people who want to fix volume loss gradually (especially in the cheeks, temples, jawline). It\u2019s also great if you\u2019re looking for something that builds over time rather than looks like a sudden change. Most people need a few sessions spaced out over months to see the full effect. Any downsides? It\u2019s not immediate \u2014 so if you want a quick fix, this isn\u2019t it. And again, it\u2019s technique-sensitive, so you really want an experienced injector who understands how to layer and space out treatments. Hope this helps clear it up a bit \u2014 it\u2019s definitely not a one-size-fits-all treatment, but for the right person, it can be a game-changer.",

I originally went in for filler but the doctor suggested we try Sculptra instead. Have gone to her for 10 years and trust her implicitly so was confident in her suggestion. Extremely hapoy overall.",

I had it injected in the apical triangle to correct nasolabial folds, cheeks, jawline, and temples. The results are very gradual, so definitely not an instant gratification situation. Each session was about two months apart, and it took approximately one year to see full results. They recommend touchups once a year, but I am going in this year at some point for my first touchup. I was 37 when I had it done, and my injector said results would be more optimal starting earlier rather than waiting for more advanced signs of aging as it takes more product to get good results. I followed all the standard aftercare instructions and had no complications. The injections are more painful than regular facial filler or Botox because they are deeper, but it does contain a numbing agent. I would say it is no where near as painful as lip filler without anesthesic. I did not want to erase all signs of aging or have an extreme or jarring result, and feel it did a great job helping restore lost volume. I feel like I look more like myself before I experienced volume loss.",

It has taken a long time to figure out what to avoid. It might help your skin if you avoid triggers for these. Oils especially can be a problem as you well know. While it has become trendy, that doesn't negate the usefulness of MCT oil, or medium chain triglycerides. They also go by \"capric / caprylic triglycerides\" or such on ingredients labels. MCT oil can safely be used for oil cleansing. It is non-triggering because it helps balance your skin microbiome. MCT oil does not feed any of the organisms that trigger issues. Most oil cleansers use olive oil or similar for the base and they are some of the most triggering oils there are, as you have found. It is a feast for certain organisms and can throw skin out of balance. After this experience, I don't blame you if you never want to try oil cleansing again. Maybe start with a patch test of MCT oil and go from there? It might be useful as a safe moisturizer for you, even if you don't end up using it for oil cleansing. It's reasonably priced, you won't spend more than $20 and prob less for a big bottle that will last a long time, probably a year. I even use it on my scalp as a pre-wash treatment and sparingly on the lengths/ends of my dry hair to smooth frizz. Just extra ideas for you to use up the bottle of oil. BTW, niacinamide triggers ance for me but it takes about 10 days of use to start showing up. You may want to test if it is also a trigger for your acne. It has become popular lately and is showing up in many products. In the meanwhile, you may want to try some salicylic acid to help clear your pores. Most acne care products can be drying and the MCT oil can help counter that.",
      "Yeah, oil cleansers don\u2019t work for my combo oily skin. I\u2019m super blemish prone, and even with actives and adapelene keeping my skin pretty clear, oil cleansers trigger my cystic acne so bad. Double cleansing with a balm cleanser first works better for me.",
      "I'm looking at the ingredients and it's possible that your skin might not do well with olive oil/monounsaturated fatty acids or palmitic acid/ethylhexyl palmitate (which can be comedogenic). I've read that acne-prone skin tends to do better with high linoleic acid oils (I often see sunflower oil recommended as an oil cleanser base for oily/acne-prone skin). Or, you might just be super sensitive to any level of oxidation in oils- my skin tends to be like that.",
      "I noticed when I double cleansed it was really drying my skin out and messing up my moisture barrier. Which, when your skin is dry, it produces more oil and more oil means more breakouts. I started exclusively oil cleansing, and it's been so much better. I also use just plain organic hemp seed oil which I've read is very close in composition to your skins natural oil, so it's not irritating.",
      "Its honestly not for everyone. Its a hill Im willing to die on; oil cleansing is not for everyone no matter the oil or cleanser you use later. I tried the original method using DHC oil cleanser, tried many months later with hada labo - then again a few months later with an oil cleanser that was korean that was highly recommended for acne prone combination skin. All of them resulted with the same thing; cystic acne and white heads. No matter what I did, this was always the result. I got rid of oil cleansing and now rely on BHA to remove my filaments. Tough lesson to learn; I really liked how soft my skin felt later and the massages lol. Not worth the cystic acne though."

      "I\u2019ve actually had something super similar happen during one of my TMJ Botox visits, so I totally get the confusion (and frustration). I also booked for the 50-unit option, and like you, I usually get around 30\u201340 units in my masseters, with the rest used for a little softening around the eyes or forehead (depending on what I need). The one time I had a new injector, she used exactly 32 units and didn\u2019t touch anything else \u2014 and I only realized after the fact that the rest hadn\u2019t been used. When I followed up, the clinic explained that some practitioners are very by-the-book and will only treat the exact concern you\u2019re booked in for unless it's pre-cleared. She wasn\u2019t being shady, just more conservative, especially since TMJ dosing can vary based on muscle size, strength, and how reactive your body is to Botox. That said, if you paid for 50 units, you *should absolutely* get all 50 \u2014 or at the very least, have a clear explanation as to why they weren\u2019t used. Whether it\u2019s refunded, banked for later, or used cosmetically like you\u2019re used to, there should be transparency. It\u2019s your face, and your money. Hopefully the clinic makes it right \u2014 and if this injector isn\u2019t for you, no shame in requesting someone you\u2019re more comfortable with next time. That relationship and communication really matters. Hope this helps!"

Shave at the end of your shower so the hair is fully softened and pores are open. This makes everything so much smoother. Use a sharp razor, not a sad, dull one. Try something like the Gillette Venus Sensitive or Billie razor (both designed for sensitive skin). Use a fragrance-free shave cream or oil. Avoid drying foams. Try products made specifically for the bikini area. Shave in the direction of hair growth. Especially if you\u2019re prone to bumps. Once the skin adjusts, you might be able to go against the grain for extra smoothness, but don\u2019t rush that! Use short, light strokes and rinse the blade often. Immediately rinse with cool water to close pores. Then, pat, not rub, dry with a clean towel. Apply a soothing, fragrance-free moisturizer like Vanicream, Eucerin Advanced Repair Lotion or Aloe vera gel. Don\u2019t use alcohol-based toners or anything with fragrance post-shave. Don\u2019t wear tight, synthetic underwear right after shaving. Go for breathable cotton or nothing if you\u2019re staying home.

      "I\u2019ve been in the same spot it\u2019s weird when you\u2019re putting in the effort, but things still look off. That morning yellow tone could just be from overnight dryness or gunk building up while you sleep. Happens to a lot of people and usually clears up after brushing. As for whitening toothpastes most of them only remove surface stains, not deeper discoloration, so if the yellowing is under the enamel, they\u2019ll only do so much. And oil pulling can help a bit with oral hygiene, but it\u2019s not a game-changer for whitening. If you\u2019re not seeing results with what you\u2019re using, you might want to try: A gentle electric toothbrush (cleans more effectively than manual) Cutting back on staining foods/drinks like coffee, tea, soda, and soy sauce Using a remineralizing toothpaste with hydroxyapatite or nano-hydroxyapatite (safer than peroxide and helps rebuild enamel) Also, whitening strips or pens can work, but only if your enamel is in good shape and you're not already dealing with sensitivity. You're on the right track sometimes it just takes dialing in what specifically works for your teeth. Keep at it.",
      "Are your teeth abnormally yellow or just normal yellow? They arent supposed to be white, and it\u2019s possible to have tooth colour blindness where you think they\u2019re yellow but they\u2019re actually totally normal. I\u2019d get a second opinion first because it might be a lot easier to just accept normal tooth colour than pursue a whiteness you will never be able to achieve. That said, crest white strips are effective if your teeth could use a little brightening.",
      "dental hygienist here: let me preface by saying, if you lapse with your oral hygiene and your gums become red and swollen (gingivitis), the red gums always make teeth look more yellow then they are. pink firm gums make your teeth look whiter. so work on oral hygiene 1st, flossing is extremely important. especially if you are going to add whitening agents in, they can make ur teeth and gums super sensitive, so you want to make sure OH is 10/10. secondly, there are two types of staining, intrinsic and extrinsic. intrinsic staining is from the inside of the tooth/teeth, over production of minerals if the tooth becomes dead etc. however, yours is probably extrinsic. extrinsic staining is from food and drinks, coffee, tea, wine, dark berries etc. after you consume these foods/drinks, swish water around your mouth and spit out. this will make it so no further staining happens. like ur coffee cup, after you drink coffee you see it stain the cup, thats whats happening to your teeth. go see a hygienest/dentist so they can clean all the stain and plaque off, they will use a prohy paste which is slightly abrasive and will polish up the teeth making them look brighter. work on your oral hygiene and floss, and they should go back to 'normal'. after a couple weeks/months and you feel that theyre not as bright as you want, then you can introduce whiteneing toothpastes or agents. there are two different types of whitening toothpastes. some will just be abrasive and will \"polish them\" - dont waste your money on these, if you actually want whitening, look for hydrogen peroxide inside. brush your teeth with the hydrogen peroxide toothpaste but DO NOT RINSE. a common misktake is rinsing after brushing, but youre actually rinsing away all the whitening agensts, and you want your saliva to uptake the minerals and also keep the whitening agents on your teeth for about 20 mins. then you can rinse. youl find youre teeth will whiten up quicker and better, however, only start introducing these agents once your oral hygiene has improved.",
      "The 3D Supreme Bright Crest strips are the most whitening out of all of the crest strips. I also use their purple toothpaste before an event and the combo is great \u2728\ud83e\uddb7",
      "I used to use Crest 3D whitestrips, once they were out of stock and I noticed CVS had their own brand for like 1/3rd the price. Those work amazingly, and I've used them 2x a year since. Maybe try looking for a generic brand in a drugstore near you, or on Amazon? Make sure you don't leave them on more than 30 min! It won't give you extra results and can really sensitize you. This is a really strong product."

      "Using retinol on your body once a week without sunscreen isn\u2019t guaranteed to wreck your skin, but it definitely increases the risk of sun sensitivity (even with just once a week use), hyperpigmentation, dryness or irritation and long-term photoaging, which is kind of the opposite of what you\u2019re going for. Even though you're only using it once a week, retinol changes how your skin behaves. It makes it thinner and more sensitive to UV exposure every day, not just the day after you apply it. Even if you're not using it daily, your skin\u2019s defenses are lower. If you're using body retinol, especially on areas that see daylight (arms, chest, legs), sunscreen is a must."

Do exfoliants and retinoids on different nights. Always use sunscreen daily, because these treatments make your skin more vulnerable to UV damage.

They are very natural looking - nude finish and not long. But - it\u2019s expensive over time. I\u2019m more into skincare than makeup - I do love facials as I find them relaxing. I shave my legs - never tried waxing. But oh my - I could have a beauty appointment every day if I wanted to do everything out there.

I spend a little more for quality and don't cake it on. A quality skincare routine over cakes of makeup all day.

That\u2019s not a way to live. We have to learn to realize the natural beauty in us.

      "just be genuinely clean but in your own way skin \u2014 find your skin type (oily, dry, combination or normal). have a steady skincare routine that you are going to stick with your entire life (that actually works) make sure the products in your routine suits your skin type. also a little tip for girlies who have sensitive and acne prone skin, use products that are fungal acne safe instead of just acne safe because they take fungal acne more seriously. hair \u2014 find your hair type (1a, 1b, etc) & your greasiness level. listen to your scalp, if it\u2019s oily or itchy wash it immediately, don\u2019t listen to anyone who say wash once a day or once a week or twice a week, it might work for them but not you because everyone\u2019s hair is different. find your porosity too. (high & low or just middle). also for low porosity girlies use hair products that are light weight, like when you put it on your palm it drips down kinda light because that will help your hair absorb it better. also if your hair is straight but frizzy, brush it after the shower while it\u2019s wet and blow dry it from the above, don\u2019t move your hair around. body \u2014 yk just shower everyday and wear a lotion if you don\u2019t want to wear the cream ones there are spray on lotions. also spray on a teeny tiny bit of perfume after a shower even when you are at home. when you sit down after a shower and can smell the clean fragrance of soap combined with lotion and a hint of the perfume yk you cleaned well clothes \u2014 find your body type (pear, apple, hourglass, rectangle, etc..) once you find the style that fits your body & that you actually like. you are going to stick with it. makeup & other things \u2014 find your tone (warm, cool & neutral) you are going to choose your makeup products, jewelry & clothes based on it. also for makeup make sure to know your visual weight (low, high, medium) it helps a ton. same with finding your face shape and applying your makeup & doing your brows according to it. everything in here is free (except buying the products) you don\u2019t need to get an analysis or anything, you can just go on tiktok and find out how to do it",

Instead of t shirts, buy knit tops. Instead of jeans, buy a nice skirt or trousers. Make sure the fabric is good quality and preferably not synthetic.

Try also the lip tint, the Sacheu peel offs are great and will stay all day and you can just add a lipgloss on top. I get my eyebrows threaded and it makes a big difference in my face shape.

      "Honestly, sometimes less is more. I once worked with a woman who was absolutely lovely, but she wore so much fragrance that you could literally taste it when she walked by. I had an awkward moment where I had to ask her not to come into my office because I could smell and taste her perfume for a long time after she had left and it was just nauseating. she would also layer a ton of different scents, which just didn\u2019t smell good mixed together, after awhile just smelled like sweet cough syrup. People were constantly making comments behind her back about it, and people would try to finish quickly when she entered the break room otherwise you would have your lunch ruined with tasting her perfume. On the other hand, I had a boss who wore a really lovely perfume and she applied it properly, that way it wasn\u2019t wafting through the entire building when she entered, but rather you really only smelled it when you were standing right next to her, and it was very light and very lovely. Only lingered for a few seconds after she left my office but was always pleasant. She always bought each one of us a really nice fancy gift for our birthday and for my birthday one year she bought me the male version of that cologne until this day. It\u2019s still my favorite cologne on a man when applied properly. People forget that your personal fragrance shouldn\u2019t leave your personal space. If you walk into a room and everyone can smell you, that is actually not a good thing. However, if you pass by someone and they get a pleasant waft of your fragrance and leaves them wondering what smells so amazing, that is intriguing. i\u2019ve never gone up to somebody who absolutely reeked and asked them what kind of fragrance they were wearing. your best bet is to find a signature scent that you really like and then use each of those products to layer the scent. body wash, body butter, body splash and hand lotion all of the same fragrance layered after a shower makes for a nice buildup of that same fragrance on different hot points of your body.",
      "you're speaking my coco-vanilla language. as a former fragrance specialist in dubai, here are my tips and secrets: 1. layer, layer, layer. everyone on here who suggested layering everything from oils to shampoos to lotions, do all that. top it all of with a fragrance mist. in the middle east, people also walk through smoke clouds of bakhour but that may be too difficult to find outside of the middle east. 2. when it comes to perfume layering (if you really want to be ott and i highly suspect you do), put on the more viscous stuff first (such as oils) and then finish off with a spray (or a couple of sprays) of your final perfume. do a hair mist as well for good measure. 3. my favorite vanilla/coconut scents: kayali utopia vanilla coco (i've been selfishly gatekeeping this one \ud83e\udd79 it's also always out of stock. secret tip: layer with al rehab's choco musk, you are very welcome). kayali vanilla 28, the body shop's coconut line (pair with vanilla perfume oils), kuumba made black coconut perfume oil, el nabil musc chocolat blanc perfume oil, comptoir sud pacifique's vanille abricot, aquolina pink sugar, prada candy, herbal essences coconut hair care line, bianco latte (stays on forever and ever, amen), lush let the good times roll, lush sticky dates, lush yog nog, lush super milk (hints of lemon tho, beware), mac candy yumyum, anything bath and body works with cake or vanilla in its name (i hoard like crazy but currently i love vanilla confetti sparkle layered with happy birthday), estee lauder bronze goddess, sol de janeiro cheriosa 62, victoria's secret candy baby (long discontinued but omg it's eat me now delicious). 4. in the shower, use everything coconut, vanilla or both from shower gel, shampoo, soap, conditioner, etc. then body lotion. then scented body powder (a lot of people forget that this helps). then perfume oils. then mist. then perfume. then hair mist. then bakhour or vanilla scented incense in a pinch (please always be mindful when burning \ud83d\ude05). i hope this helps. edit - added a few more tips",
      "meant mostly for wavy/curly hair but I just bought \u201cWhipped Vanilla Cream Curl Curl Enhancing Gel\u201d by Donna\u2019s Recipe and it smells very much like vanilla frosting!! It also works excellently at holding a curl/wave if that\u2019s relevant to you too lol. As for body spray, Cheirosa 71 Perfume Mist by Sol de Janeiro smells like vanilla with hints of caramel and toasted marshmallow. I get a lot of compliments on it and I usually lightly mist some into my hair because hair holds the scent fora while. Now for lotion I use the vanilla scented oil infused one made by Nivea. It is AMAZING at keeping skin soft and hydrated and smells hella good too. If you want even more extra vanilla pizzazz in your life too, the Burt\u2019s Bees vanilla bean one can be there for you for that extra assist \ud83e\udd1d",
      "For hair, Cake Beauty mousse or hairspray, Pacifica Big Waves spray (it smells like banana at first but dries down a very warm and toasty coconut vanilla), or Kinky-Curly Curling Custard (smells exactly like vanilla custard). For fragrance, bath and body works Vanilla Bean Noel (seasonal only so snatch it up now) smells very similar to the EOS lotion. For better quality perfumes (which if you love fragrance I highly recommend investing in) you would probably love Commodity Milk Bold, Replica Vanilla Madeleine, and if you have the budget, Tom Ford Vanilla Sex- it is a very sweet and intense vanilla and marzipan scent, almost too much even for me. And don\u2019t stop at body products, your laundry and the candles/incense you burn at home add a lot to your personal scent. Your laundry scent will disappear to you but not others and will conflict with your desired scent. If you can\u2019t find a detergent with the scent you want get unscented and use a gourmand fabric softener or linen spray. Don\u2019t forget to use it on your bedding, that\u2019s 8ish hours of scent transfer if you\u2019re an evening washer or don\u2019t shampoo daily."

      "Morpheus8 is a non surgical microneedling treatment that uses radio frequency to tighten skin and build elastin and collagen.

Eva Longoria is the spokesperson for INMODE that\u2019s the brand that makes the device and praises it amazing results for face and body. Kim Kardashian and the rest of the Kardashian clan also rave about its benefits. Kim has treated her stomach after each childbirth, as well as her face and other areas of her body.

I\u2019m an MA that works at a Med Spa. I have seen amazing results first hand. You can usually do a free consultation prior and get a better idea of how many treatments you will need and what type of results you can expect. It takes weeks for your body to build new collagen and elastin, so the treatments are spaced about 4 weeks apart. Just a non surgical option, but as I said earlier it won\u2019t be the same as a tummy tuck, nor does it cost anywhere near as much! If going under the knife or being put under general anesthesia is a concern, this may be a treatment worth considering. Best of luck!",

I mean French manicures are basically the bread and butter of any salon! If they can't even manage to do a decent but basic French manicure, they seriously need to do some additional training and take more time to practice. And no hate to any nail techs reading this.

And I say this with full love and kindness. Those look like shit. How she let you walk out that door with those is WILD. And it's not your fault. She didn't do what you asked for, actually she did WORSE than any French tip I've ever seen. Not only is it the wrong shape, it's bumpy, uneven lines, clearly no shaping of the nail to make it natural looking, the wrong color and wrong length. I used to go to a salon and get my nails done a few times a week cause they're local, down the street and nice women ...after the 3rd time of them not only making my nails to thick , the wrong shape and not the same design at all (I would pay extra to get gems and designs) it looked like crap, and I literally stopped going there and learned to do my nails myself. That's how much I refuse to pay for bad service now. The audacity of her to literally point at your money and basically ask you to give it to her is disgusting imo. How she has any business at all is baffling with that behavior. And also the fact she cut you...did she stop to fix it and clean her tools or get a new set? Cause if not...that could put her in legal trouble. Either way, you shouldn't have even given 0$ tip let alone 10$. They owed YOU for that bad nail work.

      "Omg girl! I tried Native once and wasn\u2019t impressed with it. It didn\u2019t give me this issue but I think it\u2019s because I was using homemade deodorant for several years prior to the big aluminum free brands started dropping in the market and I put a little baking soda in mine. I was using a new one that starts with a B-can\u2019t remember the name but I\u2019m pregnant and it started smelling like yogurt after my symptoms kicked in. It grossed me out so now I use EO spray and went back to Schmidt\u2019s. They have a baking soda free line. I rotate Schmidt\u2019s and the EO. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through all of this!! I know you\u2019re in pain. It seems antibiotics aren\u2019t helping and probably over drying it all so making it worse. I\u2019m wondering if castor oil packs would be helpful for pulling out the infection for the folliculitus and the staph? With maybe a tiny amount of tea tree oil if you can stand it? Wishing you the best. \ud83d\udc9c",

      "Oh wow. I\u2019ve never used natural deodorant, I\u2019ll just stick with my full of aluminum Dove. But I do have friends that like to try different natural deodorants. Will have to see if any of them have experienced these issues. Hoping it goes away for you soon!",
      "It's definitely the baking soda. Baking soda is an alkaline irritant which completely screws with the ph of healthy skin. The same issue exists with Wild deodorant which is the UK's answer to Native. I've been using Wild for years now but had to switch about a month in to their \"sensitive\" version which is baking soda free. I have notoriously hardy skin. Nothing breaks me out. When I first tried it I was using their regular version which worked well at first, then I broke out in an itchy painful rash under my arms about 3 weeks in. No issues since switching to the baking soda free version and it performs really well. It's baffling to me that any of these companies even bother with a formula that they know is going to do this to people's skin when they have other options. Why not just make the baking soda free version as standard?! I'm convinced that all the influencers who they pay to promote it don't actually use it otherwise more people would know that the regular formula is dangerous. ETA: I am aware that for many people baking soda doesn't cause irritation and they can use the regular formula just fine. Body chemistry varies from person to person. But it's still a very common irritant for enough people that baking soda free formulas become necessary. Companies like Wild and Native should be much more up front about it in their marketing that it contains an ingredient that many may be sensitive to. It's the cosmetic equivalent of putting peanuts in a food product and not mentioning it when you sell it to people.",

I went to urgent care in tears and apologizing because I hadn\u2019t been able to use soap or deodorant or anything for like 4 days by that point. They said it was a fungal infection, and that it\u2019s pretty common for natural deodorants because they\u2019re typically preservative free or something? Idk, I took like a week off work (physical job with uniforms that chaffed in that area, there was no way) and used the cream they prescribed every day. It still took almost 3 weeks for it to completely go away, it was horrible."

My job paid well so I got my hair permanently straightened, FINALLY got lasik (for distance vision; my eyes were too dry for contacts and glasses gave me headaches.. I went for many years squinting) and I got my over plucked eyebrows microbladed. My appearance, \\*chefs kiss\\* Approaching my 30s I was consistent with sunscreen, moisturizer, lotion, etc. Less obsessed with shaving or waxing - less concerned with weight, more into quality food and staying active to feel good. I kept my hair and skin routine minimal, I never bothered with trends. I had way more confidence and could afford a totally different lifestyle than when I was say, 20 and a student. I look back at old photos or think of memories of when I wore clothes I felt uncomfortable in (think of low rise jeans). Or I tried out hairstyles I'd pull at all day. The older I got, the better I felt about what I thought looked good or felt good. Another difference now is affording to maintain the things I decide to do. A big aesthetic investment was getting tattoos, I have a bunch of floral tats that have made me feel more at home in my own body. During the pandemic I stopped wearing a bra, it felt SO liberating to wear things braless. I was always self conscious about having a smaller chest. My compromise for support or needing more coverage for work, is wearing a bralette. Some are padded and give me just as much support and shape as a regular wired bra. No more needing a push up and super padded bra like when I was younger. I had a baby a few months ago and while my body has changed pretty dramatically (especially after an emergency c-section) I still feel beautiful and more confident than in my 20s. I used to be SO self conscious.

Did I get hid on (or rather harassed) a LOT more when I was in my early 20s? Yes. Do I think it was because I was more attractive then? No. I think I was like a lamb among wolves, just radiating naivety and therefore attracting creeps like flies to a melting slushy. Now I look more mature because I am more mature. This is of course showing in \u201csigns of aging\u201d (which I consider beautiful btw), but much more in the way I carry myself and interact with my surroundings.

I didn\u2019t know how to dress for my body, would give myself bangs because I wanted to be Jess from New Girl, (don\u2019t know what I was thinking, I ended up looking like friar tuck for about five years). Also I was carrying a bit of extra weight from bad habits, and though chubby definitely does NOT equal ugly, you could see how unhealthy I was from my general pallor and the way I was carrying it. Then at about 27, a few things started to change. - I got a decent paying job and was able to buy myself nutritious food consistently, instead of living off high the sodium garbage I\u2019d eaten all through uni and living abroad. I lost about 10 kilos over a slow period. My face slimmed down which has made a big difference to the way I look, and my skin quality is much better. - I started dressing for my body type, and figured out my colour theory. Colour theory has been huge for me. I\u2019m a low contrast neutral girlie, and I\u2019d been dying my hair dark, dark brown for years, and wearing all the wrong colours. I have an Aniston type balayage with face framing layers now and people literally stop me in the street and ask for my hairdressers name. Friar Tuck has come a long way. We no longer speak of box die or bangs in this house. -This one may surprise you, but I cut back significantly on skin care. I think having terrible acne for most of my life had me in a cycle of product overuse. I was giving myself serious issues, dryness, irritation, acne, dermatitis. Don\u2019t listen to influencers, your skin is far too unique to take stock advice from some chick on instagram who\u2019s just trying to flog a bunch of crap for money. I cut out everything but Cerave cleanser and an oil free moisturiser with an SPF. Skin is perfect. It\u2019s trial and error but don\u2019t be afraid to do LESS if you\u2019re having issues with your skin. -Last one is just personal preference but I quit the gym and started walking and swimming at the beach. Obviously exercise is great in any form, but I\u2019m too socially anxious for the gym. I get panicked I\u2019m using the equipment wrong, I don\u2019t look anyone in the eye because I\u2019m terrified of awkward interactions with juiced up gym bro\u2019s and the sweaty air con smell makes me gag. It put me off exercising (which I need to do or I\u2019ll be put in an asylum) so I\u2019ve found that getting my heart rate up in nature has made me much happier in general. I think the biggest lesson for me - learn how to enhance the reality of who you *are*, instead of trying to turn yourself into a stranger. I still love chucking on a bit of fake tan, makeup and getting highlights, but I\u2019m using those things to spice up my reality, not try to create a new one. Whether it\u2019s a haircuts, clothes, food or skincare, you will end looking and feeling weird and wrong if you aren\u2019t doing what suits you. X",
      "Nope. \ud83d\ude42\u200d\u2194\ufe0f Once a troll, always a troll, that\u2019s the case for me. I have been waiting for a glow up my whole life. I am 36, and as 37 approaches, I am slowly resigning myself to getting uglier and uglier. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

      "okay so i sorta had this a couple months ago, did a bunch of research and now its gone.. products i use is the First Aid Beauty KP bump easer scrub to exfoliate once a week, also before shaving. The Ordinary Glycolic Acid toner, can use this a couple times a week, after the shower make sure your legs are completely dry, don\u2019t put any moisturizer or products (which was hard for me since i usually put on moisturizer right away after the shower) but once your dry tap the toner all over your lower leg, wait 10 mins to let the toner soak in & then you can put on moisturizer. Also, shave down with the grain first, & then you can shave upwards. Make sure to have a light hand while shaving! this is important too because having a heavy hand while shaving can irritate the skin more. Once you use these two products to open up and clean your pores, shave w the grain with a light hand i\u2019m sure you will see a difference:)! you can also look up reviews on the two products i mentioned on tiktok to show how to use and they work great. The Ordinary toner also works for multiple things, can put on armpits and you will stop needing deodorant, can put on your scalp & more. & it\u2019s only $15. the KP bump easer is $15 in a mini (what i got and it fixed my legs & now im probably going to buy full size, $40) both products at sephora:)) another extra thing i do now that i dont have the bumps on my legs anymore is use a body oil to have baby smooth legs, i use the SDJ oil but i wouldn\u2019t recommend it until the bumps are gone bc you dont want to clog your pores\u263a\ufe0f",
      "I have the same issue - I get bumps on my upper arms too (very much unsure if they\u2019re related). I\u2019ve found that any hair removal ends up with the same result but what does help is exfoliating pretty heavily before AND after shaving. I\u2019ve also stopped shaving as often which seems to help with irritation, although I understand the need to if you must. I use an exfoliating mitt in the shower before and after a shave then use unscented lotion like Aveeno after. A sugar and coffee scrub works well too for exfoliating. Definitely share what ends up helping! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",
      "Invest small money in IPL machine for laser and do it at home. I got laser done that helped but I needed more sessions for some parts so I recently bought one, yet to use but once I asked similar question and ton of ladies advised for ipl. I wish I had done it all at home. But no regrets. Even if you save 30 bucks a month, you can get one in a deal in a few months and save this life time of misery. Hope this helps.",

      "This is exactly what my legs look like. The dark spots are flat, it's just the hair growing underneath. I get the red bumps when I shave while I'm cold and have goosebumps. If I make sure I'm really nice and warm, no goosebumps, I don't get the red spots. If your spots are like mine, it definitely isn't KP. My husband has KP on his arms, and it's nothing like my legs. For the dark hair spots, the only thing that ever got rid of it for me is laser hair removal. I had it done professionally years ago and now have an at home laser. It works great! It needs to be done way more often, but it's worth it to save so much money."

      "My skin used to look like this. I was shaving every time I showered with a razor that had three blades, getting a very close shave. The issue was that at some point I had begun a cycle of irritating my skin, causing follicles to become raised. Then I would shave again while they were still irritated, FURTHER irritating them. I fixed this by letting my hair grow out until my skin fully healed, and started to only shave my legs once a week at most. I also feel like my leg hair doesn't grow back out as quickly this way - I think because I'm actually getting a very close shave because the follicles aren't inflamed. And because they're not inflamed, they're also not pointing the hair out as much, they grow out smoothly. It used to bother me a lot when my hair would grow back when my skin was irritated, because it felt so prickly and irritated under clothes. Now it grows back soft.",
      "My legs were just like yours. I hated the dark pores left from shaving. I also had bad irritation from waxing, so that wasn't an option. Two years ago I went onto eBay and bought a used IPL device - one of the latest Philips models at the time. It worked so incredibly well. I did the whole system on my legs one round, and on my bikini line and underarms two rounds. I now have pretty much no hair in those areas. They just need a little tidying in the sparse bits where the hair was most stubborn. It has saved me so much time, money, and annoyance. No more spotty legs!",

I have a nickel allergy and I'm allergic to Methylisothiazolinone which is in both. Switched to the leaf razor. I get a closer shave and now have more control over what blades I use.

      "What type really depends on how long you need them to last and how hard you\u2019ll be on them. I waitressed and was brutal on my hands so I went with gel and dip. They would last me between a week and two weeks depending on how busy work was. Acrylics and gel x with tips will last even longer I just didn\u2019t love the feel of them on me, personal preference. You could stretch gel x or acrylic for up to 4 weeks tho with proper care which would be good if you\u2019re taking an extended honeymoon or something after your wedding where you don\u2019t want to worry about chipped nails or fills somewhere exotic Yes you can absolutely get regular polish, but I wouldn\u2019t. Salons apply it better than we can at home but it can still chip and peel as easily as if you DIY\u2019d, there are so many better options out there now for polish that are more durable. Dip and gel both just go on top of your regular nail and can be removed with acetone at home but they can damage your natural nails if you take them off wrong so make sure to google tips before you self remove. Gel x and acrylic are built on top of and past the end of your natural nail and you generally need to go back to the salon to have them either filled or removed, so that\u2019s another thing to think of if you want either of those that you\u2019ll need to go back for a removal appointment. These also usually involve filing down your nails and can leave you with brittle and breakable nails until they fully grow out which can be annoying if you don\u2019t want to keep monthly fill appointments. Your nails kind of become dependent on them after a while for strength in my experience The inspo nails in the pic are absolutely beautiful and really give wedding vibes. I can\u2019t tell what type of polish they are but if that\u2019s the look and length you want I\u2019d recommend gel or dip depending on the color range of the salon. Grow your nails out for a week or two before the appointment so you have length to work with because shaping will lose some length, if they\u2019re too short to shape you\u2019ll have to get extension tips or acrylics to achieve it. Ask for a neutral base color and a chrome overlay and pick whatever shade of chrome best matches your accessories. The base color will decide how much the chrome will \u201cpop\u201d, for example a white base will make the topper look brighter and a pinky nude will be more subtle. Bring pictures of your dress, makeup inspo, and jewelry so your nail tech can help you figure out the best shade to compliment everything. Congrats on your wedding! I hope this helped a bit ETA: I thought these were your nails not inspo, fixed my advice accordingly",
      "That\u2019s a beautiful color choice! Love a good pearl chrome. I\u2019ve tried it all. Regular polish, gel polish, dip, tips with acrylic, and now I get gel overlay which I like the best for longevity. I use my hands a lot at work so I need something that will last and not chip or break for weeks at a time. So you\u2019ll need to know the pros and cons of what that salon offers. Also, what nail shape best suits your fingers. I always think a shorter almond shape is classy on everyone. Pinterest has a lot of pictures of nails with different shapes and colors on different skin tones. So check that out!",
      "If you're getting normal polish, it may chip if you aren't careful. A gel will be much hardier, but it do a bit of damage to your nails that you will need to grow out effectively once it's removed. If you get fakes, they'll feel weird for a bit. All these are costly these days. Best to go to a salon that a friend trusts. Press on nails are also pretty good these days mind you, are quite cheap and might be a option to consider. I believe that some brands last up to two weeks.",
      "Beautiful reference photo. I will say that this looks like a Russian manicure, which is a technique that involves precise cuticle work that results in a very clean looking manicure. It is controversial and illegal in some places (it\u2019s illegal in my state of Florida) because it involves cutting live skin which COULD lead to infections if not done correctly. I\u2019m not here to tell you whether it\u2019s right or wrong, but the law is the law. You can achieve a similar effect by getting a dry manicure. Which is exactly how it sounds, it\u2019s a manicure without soaking the nails, and detailed cuticle work but doesn\u2019t usually involve a cutting implement. I would not recommend just going to any random nail salon. Do your research! The last thing you want is to have a nail salon fiasco and now you have to find a way to fix your nails quickly before the wedding. Go on instagram and search for techs in your area that have reference photos similar to this. It can be a salon or an independent tech. I would ask for a dry manicure with \u201cvanilla chrome\u201d which would be an off white nail base, with pearl chrome on top. I would definitely Recommend gel polish. From the photo, this could be a gel manicure or, most likely, could be a structured manicure. Structure gel is a type of gel that is thicker than regular gel polish, designed to go under colored gel polish to create a sturdier base. It lasts even longer than a gel manicure, it leaves your nails very sturdy and isn\u2019t as damaging as acrylic. If you want your nails to last, and you don\u2019t want to worry about any last minute chipping, I\u2019d say go for the structured gel. I\u2019m not sure when you\u2019re getting married, but I suggest doing a trial and getting your nails done a month or so before the wedding to see if you actually like them or not. That way you can make some tweakings or completely change your mind so your nails are perfect when you\u2019re walking down the aisle. Congrats on the wedding! - friendly neighborhood nail tech",

Thruth is, my natural thickness is the one thay fits my face better, and I should have only gotten a bit of shaping over the years, instead i now have a shape that is a bit unatural to my face- and that i am trying to grow out. My point is your eyebrows are gorgeous. If you are unsure, look at your face without make-up and see whether you feel like there is a good balance in your features. If you feel like they are too heavy, start slow with some additional shaping and go from there. Because it is a lot harder to grow them back if you do a drastic removal.",

I buy good quality clothes that fit (or get tailoring if they don\u2019t), lots of wool, linen, cotton and leather. My clothes and shoes are always in good condition, ironed, etc. I tend to keep within my kibbe and Kitchener things (I\u2019m a dramatic classic with primarily classic essence), because I just look best in tailored, sharper lines, with neat hair and clean, classic makeup and clean lines with jewellery. I also keep mostly to my seasonal color palette, so that most of what I wear enhances my features. I don\u2019t really do fashion, just stick with classic silhouettes and fabrics. I like eg fine Marino sweaters with a clean neckline, fitted button down shirts, chinos, shift dresses, and pantyhose and loafers or court shoes\u2026 Minimal makeup (I have always been a makeup minimalist, focus on skincare, groomed brows, slightly whitened teeth), with a \u201cyour x but better\u201d approach. I like brown liner and mascara, lip tint and lipstick that matches or enhances my natural like color. I work hard to keep my skin tone even and make sure my skin is hydrated. I keep a tiny spray bottle thing with glycerine, water and rosewater in it for when I\u2019m at work, so I stay glowy and moisturised in my dry ass office. Nails are always done with nude or neutral colours, or buffed and cut and clean. Minimal, high quality jewellery on my hands (eg just my plain platinum wedding band and my diamond and sapphire engagement ring, and simple watch). I try to moisturise my hands too but I am not great with that. I\u2019m a professor, so I have worked on my general presentation after (by now) hundreds of talks and lectures. When you present publicly so often, you learn to speak clearly and make your presentation style polished. That translates nicely to real life. I have good posture too, which helps a lot. I\u2019m confident and assertive, which is something I\u2019ve cultivated over my career so far, and that helps a lot with how people perceive you. I\u2019m fit. I do triathlon, and have worked hard on getting my fitness and strength back after two kids. I usually run or cycle, and try for 6 workouts a week. I have a naturally slim frame with somewhat broad shoulders, and have always been athletic so I\u2019m lucky that I don\u2019t have to work hard to maintain fitness. I think this helps you generally look put together because (in my experience) the clothes I tend to wear fit a bit better. Lastly I\u2019m lucky that I am in a good financial position and live in a country that is safe and where I feel I can succeed in life. It\u2019s easy to feel confident and self-assured with that kind of privilege. I\u2019m also white, which obviously helps. Having privilege can\u2019t be understated with this kind of thing because having money and security helps with a lot of these things. Edit to add: perfume - I *always* make sure I smell good! Not heavy perfume (no shade - I just don\u2019t like it and it can be too much for other people around also) but clean, fresh, high quality perfume.",
      "Don\u2019t forget that fabric matters! I love thrift shopping. You can get really good quality fabrics like Cotten, linen, silk, wool etc. Properly fitted clothes is important, and the fabric can compliment or cheapen the look. Also simple things like mastering a go to style. Let\u2019s say I over sleep and need to be out the door in 10 min. I have just enough time to brush my teeth, throw on my clothes and go. Yet I still look good. How is it possible? I\u2019m intentional with the clothes I buy. The fabrics look good on me, the clothes fit nicely, and most clothes I buy go with the majority of my closet. So I don\u2019t have to think or try to look good. Also I rarely buy fabrics that need ironing. I can whip together a great look in 5 min or less because I have practiced and mastered a simple everyday makeup and hair look. (and by mastering I do mean practice 100x until you can whip it up in 2 mins or less.) Yes you can get your clothes tailored. Yet, I would encourage you to see which brands of clothing already fit you and you look good in. Once you do, you have go to brands that you can depend on the fit and don\u2019t need to adjust. Dressing well is all about intentionality. Do some of the backend work, figure out what is or isn\u2019t working for you, and then create a system from there. Then it\u2019s easy breezy lemon squeeze to look good. You can also create your own look book! When you get compliments on your outfit, take a picture of it!!! Use an instant print camera, to capture a great look. Put it in a book and when you need help putting an outfit together, you already have a guaranteed hit!",
      "TLDR; colour analysis, hairspray, skincare, accessories. I used to feel exactly the same way and over the years I\u2019ve started to figure it out. I\u2019ll give a list of what I\u2019ve personally done to make myself feel and look put together. 1. Got a colour analysis done so I know my best colours to wear, I bring a swatch when shopping and only buy \u201cmy colours\u201d (this makes op shopping way easier to narrow down what I should bother spending time looking at) NOTE: this is the most expensive tip in this list, you could consider asking for it as a gift, or even just a gift voucher contribution for it. Don\u2019t do it online to save money, it has to be in person due to the nature of skin tones/screen inaccuracy. It is well worth it. 2. I started using hairspray to slick down my flyaways. I put a ponytail in then spray hairspray onto my hands and wipe my hands over my hair to smooth it down nice and neat. Then straighten/curl my ponytail to make it presentable or (my preferred easier option) tie it into a cute messy bun (I looked up how to do a messy bun on YouTube). Just figuring out 1 or 2 neat and easy hairstyles is all you need 3. Consistent skin care. Do a little research and find a chemical exfoliant to use at night, follow it up with hyaluronic acid and a moisturiser that works for you. Vitamin c, hyaluronic acid and sunscreen in the morning will brighten your face and even out your skin tone significantly. 4. The three points above are enough to make a huge difference, but if you do all that and then want to take it to the next level, focus on accessories. Get a couple of cute bags, 1 shorter necklace and 1 longer necklace to layer together or wear on their own (3 combos), a simple but nice pair of earrings to wear daily, one nice watch and 1 or 2 cute bracelets to start. Get all this stuff from op shops, there is plenty of sterling silver jewellery in op shops for cheap, not the highest of quality but it\u2019s real jewellery that you can clean and maintain and will last. Pick either silver or gold for your jewellery - you will find out which is better for you in your colour analysis. I hope this helps, I was always messy and mismatched when I was younger with the \u201cslept in\u201d look. I\u2019m 28 now and I feel like I\u2019m really finding my \u201caesthetic\u201d, even though I used to feel like none of it made sense to me. Getting my colours done started the journey for me, it helped things to feel less overwhelming. Unfortunately that\u2019s the only step that is unavoidably expensive, but for people who don\u2019t know where to start, I think it\u2019s invaluably helpful.",
      "Clothes that fit right and clothes that are cute even if it\u2019s just gym attire will boost confidence. I personally put a little make up on and make sure my hair is brushed and put up in a way that is practical but not messy. If clothes don\u2019t fit, I alter them so they do (if I can). Knowing how to dress for your body type is helpful. I have a long torso so having things like dark pants with dark shoes elongates my legs and makes me look more proportional. I also put effort into fining a personal style that doesn\u2019t necessarily always fit what\u2019s on trend, but it\u2019s intentional stylistic choices and people can tell. Small things like having clean kept hair and nails and even eyebrows can help even when I don\u2019t wear makeup. Finally- posture. Standing and sitting up straight. It\u2019s good for your back and also gives a feeling of confidence. I only look put together because I put myself together before leaving to do anything. In my experience it is not natural. I find it relaxing to spend time with myself in this way, so it\u2019s beneficial to me over all.",
      "I\u2019ve been told I always look put together (even though I don\u2019t always feel like it). Overall, I try to abide by having at least 2 out of 3 areas on point whenever I leave the house: outfit, make-up, and hair. Accessories: I always have jewelry on. I like simple, dainty jewelry and I\u2019m also lazy so I don\u2019t ever take some of these pieces off. I always have on a simple pair of gold hoops, 3 dainty gold bracelets, and one necklace. Whenever I go out, I put on my rings and a dainty silver/gold vintage watch. Make-up: I almost always wear makeup whenever I go out. Primer, blush, mascara, eyeliner, eyeshadow, and setting spray at minimum. When I have time, I wear more a natural strip lash for a little extra. There are some days where my complexion isn\u2019t the best; I\u2019ll use a very tiny amount of foundation all over (after concealer and blush) to even it out. I try to use minimum powder to avoid the cakey look. Also, make sure you pluck any stray brows (guilty of not always doing this). Hair: I feel like I haven\u2019t mastered this, but it\u2019s good to have a go-to hair style when your hair is clean vs dirty. A slick-back bun or ponytail (experiment with different variations to see what you feel you look good with) and use a wax stick if you have a lot of baby hairs/flyaways like I do. If I want to wear my hair down, but my hair is a bit on the greasy side, I do a bit of dry shampoo and I will just wash my bangs quickly in the sink. I also will use hair oil or gloss if my ends are looking a bit dry. Clothes: I have my go-to outfits that I\u2019m comfortable in and feel good. For example, at work I\u2019ll often wear a pair of dress pants with a cashmere/wool black crewneck sweater. I make it look like I have different outfits by changing up my jacket and shoes. My advice is put together outfits and try them on in front of a full length mirror. If you wear the outfit out and there\u2019s something about it that makes you uncomfortable, don\u2019t wear it because it\u2019ll pull away from your confidence. Take inspiration from outfits you see online. It\u2019s a lot easier when it\u2019s someone who has a similar body type to you. What I also tend to do is balance my outfit out: if I\u2019m wearing loose pants, I go for a fitted top and vice versa). Also, try to avoid wearing clothes that have unintentional holes, are wrinkled, or are pilling. Nails: make sure your nails are always clean and neat. I get gel manicures and pedicures regularly. You don\u2019t need to get your nails done professionally, but I\u2019d recommend always having your nails clean (i.e having bare clean nails > having chipped polish or a broken nail)."

      "Love all the suggestions. Does anyone have a hair routine that works for a dead ass tired toddler mom who also runs/works out 3-4 times a week in the morning? I\u2019m trying to not constantly have to wash my hair/use heat.",
      "On top of what others have said, you may actually be wearing the wrong clothing size. I felt this way for years because I was wearing a U.K. size 6, and it turned out I was actually a size 4. Since switching to that size, clothing flatters my body so much more. I'm quite a petite person, in terms of my actual build and bone structure, and so clothes have a tendency to \"hang on me\" too. My mother had the same issue, and in all of her younger photos her clothing looks incredibly baggy and loose. She was simply wearing clothing a size too big. You may, alternatively, be choosing clothing that doesn't flatter your body shape. For example, I find that cropped shirts tend to make me look boxy because they obscure my waist. Look into Kibbe body types (and/or the subreddit r/kibbe) to get an idea of what might suit you. Also, look at celebrities with a similar body type to yourself. As they work with stylists, the clothing they wear to events is often (though, not always) chosen to suit their figure."

      "I so agree!! It\u2019s so pervasive, I feel like we need to share images and speak to each others in ways to actively counteract it, however ineffectual it might be. Some examples of aging, beautiful, natural (I think) faces: Maggie Smith, Amanda Plummer, Viola Davis, and Anna Magnani (\u201cPlease not retouch my wrinkles. It took me so long to earn them\u201d). Face: One Square Foot of Skin\u2019 by Justine Bateman is all about this issues, and a great mental inoculant to beauty standards. So is drawing people of all ages and types, it helps you see beauty in its many very different forms! It\u2019s hard to diplomatically criticize the filler look and other invasive beauty treatments because you don\u2019t want to make people feel even worse about themselves\u2026 It must feel awful to have something done and realize it not only didn\u2019t solve your problem but you now look worse (edit: or not necessarily worse, but not like yourself) and often, you can\u2019t undo it. But it does look so uncanny and I wish to god people wouldn\u2019t do that to their beautiful, unique faces, and at such young ages now too. I am in my late 40s and have sworn I\u2019ll never do that to myself, even if I can one day afford it, even though I have characteristics I don\u2019t think look good, screw that, I refuse to play or support that game and there are SO many better things I could spend that money on. Plastic surgery is in its dark ages - likely eventually there will be nanotech and drugs that can make everyone look perfectly youthful - but for the moment, as Bill Burr says, you pretty much have two choices, look your real age, or look like a 28-year-old lizard. Why not let one\u2019s real, interesting, craggy, aging face show, with its increasing uniqueness and traces of a full life lived, if one is lucky enough to get old. Edit: there are subtle plastic surgeons who won\u2019t make you look like a 28 year old lizard. That came off a bit harsh. There\u2019s nothing wrong with doing it, it\u2019s downright necessary and even a human right for many people with more serious facial problems, injury, scarring etc. I just think its use is too heavy handed and wish people would see that most of beauty comes from your own uniqueness, and not feel like they have to alter anything. There are so many better things to do with your life and money and seriously, you all look just fine :)",
      "I rarely see people so beautiful that I turn my head to look at them again. I did yesterday. The woman was probably in her 50s or 60s and gorgeous. She wasn't attempting to look younger than her age, but just elegant and natural. She had a nice dress, nice, short hair and nice skin. She just had an energy around her that was beautiful, and she seemed kind as well. I want to be something like that when I'm older.",
      "no i agree, i think it's weird as fuck and driven by hyper-misogynistic expectations that see women as being dolls rather than human beings. as a queer woman, i don't see as many queer women (well, those who only/mostly pursue relationships with other women) partake in excessive cosmetic surgery and other so-called 'minor' procedures like fillers as much as straight women (or women who are queer but in a relationship with a man). since most people are straight, pretty much all of the conventional beauty standards we have are driven by how straight men want women to look, and women do untold damage to their mind and body to meet those expectations and get that male validation. i also really side-eye the focus on looking as young as possible, to the point of grown women attempting to look like a child - which they are doing expressly to attract and maintain a man. do they realise what that says about them, that they want to look like a minor, but 'sexy'? do they realise what that says about the men they want to attract, that they are only interested in people who look like children? i find it really disturbing.",
      "It does feel dystopian And I say this as someone who has a little filler and botox. Got it last year at age 48. I won't get it in my lips (i think white women need to step away from the lip filler, i am a white woman) and I think it makes young people look old The point is to replace what was lost, not make you look inhuman, but i guess that's what we're going for now? I do not understand 20 and even 30 somethings freezing their face and filling it. Y'all are still young! Enjoy looking young! I also blame beauty filters. You're never going to look as good as you do when you're filtered. But if you're single and like to date men, a lot of them expect you to look that good bc that's all they ever see anymore, since dating has moved online The amount of times I've seen \"get a skincare routine\" typed to lovely women with great skin makes me sad. Everyone needs to start looking at real people again",
      "People tend to overemphasized the importance of, and go overboard on, things they wish they had So if you're a girl with kinda thin lips you might think having thick lips is everything and would change your life and you don't just want regular lips you want the biggest, plumpest lips in the room wherever you go. Then someone comes along and says hey you can inject that and it works great and is easily reversible with no side effects etc. You go for it Then it turns out to not be the magical solution it was sold as I think it's kind of a perverse incentive that people are charged for fillers by the unit, and that a single unit is still a lot. But it's also not hard when you see a little positive change to not want to make it bigger. Honestly it can be hard to not realize you went overboard. I remember J used to photoshop pictures trying to make them look as beautiful as possible and end up thinking wow they look incredible. Then I'd come back the next day and the image looked clearly terrible. I think people can experience the same thing with their own faces."

I feel the same way, I honestly feel like a victim of this industry, the first time I put filler was over 2 years ago and I've done 'touch ups' twice, so overall I have 1,3 ml in my lips. I've come to the point where I actually don't like it anymore, there is a bit of migration, but since I have a smaller amount I will leave it alone, because I am honestly even more afraid of the dissolver horror stories. I am so glad I didn't put filler anywhere else in my face, because now when I look at young girls with filler in their cheeks, jawline, chin, I get scared for them and how it will look in a few years. And even with lips, its so easy to put more and more and it starts to look scary ...And the dissolver is even scarier, so when you put so much and you don't have a safe way to remove it its just horrible...",
      "You are absolutely right. It is doubly strange and tragic for the young women having this work done, because the obvious artificial-ness of it actually makes them look prematurely old. I'm in my late 30s with no filler/work done, and I now look younger than early 20-somethings that look super strange from all the filler. Unfettered capitalism preying on women's insecurity strikes again...",

      "ohhhhh, unsexy tips for feeling feel sexier are my goddamn wheelhouse! okay: - getting my bikini line + whole ass lasered so i\u2019m always ready to go (i personally prefer a neatly manicured and trimmed bush in the front/sides rather than all-off, and then smooth at the back) - after shaving my bikini line before the laser (this tip works for the whole area though), i would wipe with isopropyl alcohol, then once the sting went away i followed with a plain, unscented antiperspirant stick deodorant like dove. it\u2019s an old stripper\u2019s trick, you\u2019ll never have irritation or ingrowns again! - conditioning my pubes in the shower with a plain, unscented, pH balanced conditioner (i use QV Gentle Conditioner, being careful not to get it inside my labia - but on the odd occasion that that has happened, it\u2019s been fine) to keep them silky soft. sometimes i even oil them with jojoba oil. what can i say, i just think nice pubes are super sexy and womanly! - using my perifit regularly to keep my pelvic floor fit - if i ever get toenail fungus, lightly filing the surface of my toenail and applying vicks vaporub on and under the nail (google it!) - a high-percentage urea foot moisturiser to keep them soft. dermal therapy brand is great - using depilatory cream on my legs because you don\u2019t get the spiky regrowth that you do from shaving and your legs are smoother for a bit longer because it\u2019s able to dissolve hair a little further inside the follicle than a razor can reach, and it exfoliates at the same time - xylitol gum after eating to counteract acidity, it triggers heaps of saliva which i\u2019ll kind of swish around between my teeth like a mouthwash lol - at home whitening once a month or so using an at-home tray kit - always flossing, and using tooth mousse once a week - i struggle with dry eyes (which get itchy and red \u2013 not sexy!) and these things have helped: using \u201cdisposable\u201d spoolies/eye liner brushes (which i then wash and spritz with hypochlorous acid because they are actually reusable) rather than the ones that come with the product (OR if the one that comes with the product is particularly special i\u2019ll cut it off and put a glob of hot glue on the end to make it easier to hold), and NEVER reinserting them in the bottle after they\u2019ve touched my eye. not using waterproof eyeliner anymore (i still use waterproof mascara when i want to hold a curl but am diligent about removing it) and never EVER putting any product on my waterlines anymore. having two sleep masks to alternate so i can wash them regularly. doing a heated eye compress and gentle eyelid massage to encourage meibomian gland expression. vaseline on my eye area and slightly into the eyelash margin on both lids before applying my tretinoin at night, then gently swiping it away the next morning with micellar water then saline, then a cotton bud that has hypochlorous acid on it along the roots of my lashes (from the lid side, not the waterline) - heatless curls at night so i wake up looking like i\u2019ve done a full blowout",
      "1. Using a fresh wash cloth and taking a shower twice a day. I live in a cold country - I slater more lotion and body cream. Smelling nice is sexy.

Dry shampoo is gross, it\u2019s adding more dirt on your hair and I can\u2019t imagine lying down on my pillow case with it. Nope! 3.

Due to encouragement of my fellow redditors here it goes: 6. Brush your teeth each meal. I always have my tooth brush and a travel size tooth paste in my purse.

Use a tiny pea size amount every other day and it shouldn't break you out Sleep with your hair in a protective style e.g. a braid, use big scrunchies and claw clips during the day rather than a slick back to prevent hair loss On the hair topic, don't be afraid to use drugstore products. Some people's hair does really well with sulphates and silicones. Use a gentl unscented cleanser for face, body, and shaving rather than a ton of different products (unless you enjoy it, then carry on!). You'll have less sensitised skin and can spend the money you save on nicer makeup, other skin or haircare products, etc If you're on a budget, do your nails at home with a glass nail file and use an orange stick or cuticle pusher to keep them looking neat and pretty"

      "Daily shaving can be done, but it takes a super gentle, consistent routine that treats your bikini area like royalty. First, cleanse the area with a gentle, unscented wash like CeraVe or Dove Sensitive. No fragrance bombs or harsh soaps! Shave at the end of your shower so the hair is fully softened and pores are open. This makes everything so much smoother. Use a sharp razor, not a sad, dull one. Try something like the Gillette Venus Sensitive or Billie razor (both designed for sensitive skin). Use a fragrance-free shave cream or oil. Avoid drying foams. Try products made specifically for the bikini area. Shave in the direction of hair growth. Especially if you\u2019re prone to bumps. Once the skin adjusts, you might be able to go against the grain for extra smoothness, but don\u2019t rush that! Use short, light strokes and rinse the blade often. Immediately rinse with cool water to close pores. Then, pat, not rub, dry with a clean towel. Apply a soothing, fragrance-free moisturizer like Vanicream, Eucerin Advanced Repair Lotion or Aloe vera gel. Don\u2019t use alcohol-based toners or anything with fragrance post-shave. Don\u2019t wear tight, synthetic underwear right after shaving. Go for breathable cotton or nothing if you\u2019re staying home. Don\u2019t exfoliate daily, it\u2019ll just make the irritation worse."

      "Yes I say it\u2019s worth the try. Differin for me just made the acne come and go faster, good but still annoying. Never got out of the purge phase. So far tretinoin is smoothing my scars a little and the texture which makes it look better. But tretinoin is easily accessible to me $2usd. I\u2019d rather use tretinoin and shell out $2 and see what it can do (I\u2019m about to enter 4th month on tret, 12 months recommended for optimal results) before I spend thousands on lasers. Loving the texture of my skin so far. You\u2019re probably familiar with this kind of story, but I already spent a shit load on acne products over the years trying to get rid of the acne. Trying to make smarter moves now. I\u2019d say it\u2019s absolutely worth the try if it\u2019s not difficult for you to access. Just be aware you will probably still need some lasers at the end. But you\u2019ll probably decrease the amount of sessions of lasers you\u2019ll need. Where I\u2019m from that\u2019s saving thousands lol Also I did have a purge myself on tret, but they didn\u2019t scar like they usually do",
      "It definitely can help with scars. I usually tell people who have acne scars to try a year on Tret if they can. I don't think it will resolve everything or leave you with the results you desire, but it will give you some progress, and that progress is progress that you can obtain at a relatively cheap price since Tret isn't very costly. It's not just about the cost; when Tret is used correctly, it's not painful like some other treatments. After that year, you can reassess the situation and choose from the other options (or you can go for these right away if you do not want to wait). You can have a series of chemical peels before starting Tret. You will need Jessner X (X for Cross, meaning it will be layered with TCA) or TCA peels alone. These are potent peels, and you will likely have a few layers of each peel done (they wait 5 minutes after applying and apply some more). A series of 6-8 peels is usually required. This should be done by a professional because the risk of injury is high when you do not know what you're doing and working with these acids. They are not like the peels you can get at a drug store, like the 2% BHA, 25% AHA. You cannot mix Tret with these. Be warned. If you want to try peels and continue with Tret after a year, you will have to quit the Tret for a certain time before and after the peels for safety reasons. You can look at microneedling (done in a medical setting). Those rollers you can get for home use won't do much. This is going to be a series of 6-12 treatments. Laser resurfacing, subcision, Botox\u2014it all depends on what you and your doctor agree on. My best advice to you would be to try Tret for a good year (you get to see most of the results that Tret can offer within a year- this is not to say that it stops working after!). You may want to look into TCA peels before, but be warned that if money is a factor, a series of 6-8 is something that your wallet is going to feel. I would do a few peels, personally, because it will likely give some results and the Tretinoin (once you start it) will be working on layers of skin below where it would have worked before/if you didn't have the peels done). You can do it without the peels. I'm just treating you how I'd want to be treated if I were you. Another option would be to say screw it to all of that and to go for the 6-12 sessions of dermarolling. Again, this will end up being costly. When I say expensive, it's not in the tens of thousands, but expect at least 100$ (CAD) per treatment. Many factors will affect the price. If you live in a city with a lot of competition, you will likely pay hundreds of dollars less than I would in my rural area, where there is no competition. I want to say that if you want to go with Tret alone for a year, you should see results. I highly doubt all the scars would be gone, but some people are happy with the reduction in scars and feel confident with the few scars they have left.",
      "Your skin looks relatively clear, I think you should go straight for microneedling instead because tretinoin is not really able to help icepick scars",
      "Gold standard is co2 resurfacing laser. These cost approx $3k a session. Watch some videos to see the before and after. If I were you I would start tretinoin and as others say: give it a go for a year. After about 4 months if your skin is tolerating it well. Everyone is different. Then start\u2026 Home microneedling: Ideally the derminator (can be purchased online). A bit more pricy than the DR Pen M8s. Derminator is said to be superior. (Less painful/ more accurate in the needling/less drag). - watching videos on tik tok and you tube will explain how, what needles you need and how deep to go. Needle once a month. If not happy after a year with the progress: Then get a consult for co2."

      "Generally if you start using tret for the first time its 1. better to ease in with adapalene + topical clindamycin 2. use a lower percentage of tret, .025% is best for beginner use It\u2019s definitely purging but also damaged skin barrier, good to use ceramides or squalene during this time as it helps soothes and build back your skin barrier. if you feel like moisturizing is too much for your skin at the moment you could just use a very hydrating serum to make up for lost moisture. ALSO!! If you\u2019re experiencing purging its best to take actives out of your routine (ie: vit c) and for best sun protection find a tinted sunscreen that has titanium dioxide + zinc oxides (but if the sunscreen you\u2019re using is your favorite one just stick with it).

Occasionally, I throw in Vanicaerm during the day since it's light (summer this works better). All of these are in my regular rotation depending on what my skin needs. Elta MD reformulated my SPF elements tinted, so I have had a heck of a time finding SPF. That was my go to for years. It matched my skin perfectly and was so nice to reapply. I've tried almost everything. I prefer tinted since I don't wear face make up anymore. Many of them are too light for me (color wise). I reapply 2-3 times each day so it has to be a one that looks good with reapplications. So far the only thing I have found that I can consistently use that blends with my olive skin and plays well with all my moisturizers is Tizo 3 Primer and SPF mineral tinted sunscreen. I can use DRMTLGY SPF matte (summer) or the dewy tinted version (dewy is good for super dry months) as well. The color is a little off but my skin does like this one. Winer I can also use healthy skin labs tinted SPF since it's really hydrating and the color matches well (too dewy for summer). Non tinted SPFs I use. LRP double repair SPF on my neck and chest as well as LRP Athelios melt in milk, especially if it's a day I'm outside more(also on my forearms and hands). I also like Naturium for my neck, chest, hands, and forearms.",

      "what moisturizer are you using? your son can become sensitive to certain ingredients like niacinamide, which are common in moisturizers, after starting in a retinoid. i'd try switching to an incredibly simple moisturizer like the vanicream lotion and see if it burns then. if it still burns when using vanicream lotion, or you're already using a very basic moisturizer and are experiencing burning, it's likely you've mildly damaged your skin barrier. imo you can continue using tretinoin whole trying to heal it, but in that case, i would nix the benzoyl peroxide and try only washing your face with water in the morning. use a rich moisturizer and also maybe slug over it on days where you're not using tretinoin, to give your skin the optimal conditions to recover and heal. if you're on a higher concentration of tret or are using the gel formulation, id recommend speaking to your dermatologist about going down in strength and/or switching to the cream, both of which would be gentler on your skin. you can always attempt moving back up in strength and/or switching back to gel once your skin has acclimated to a less harsh version",
      "It sounds like your barrier is compromised. You have a couple of options. First, I would remove the benzoyl peroxide from your routine and get a different spf. Second, I would add a hydrating toner in the am. Third, I would buffer your tretinoin with a light moisturizer, and only increase frequency once you can use treat without irritation. I would stop using tret until your barrier calms down, and you are used to the new spf and toner.",

      "Everyone is saying accutane. But my acne was similar to yours. My derm put me on tret .1% and Aza 20% and doxycycline. I used all three medications daily from the start, and my skin cleared within 6 months. It was perfectly clear by month 6. So, please know that tretinoin may actually work. But I do think the Aza 20% did a great deal of heavy lifting, so if you can get that, it may speed things along. The doxycycline also helped a great deal with the inflammation. If you can\u2019t get that, try taking zinc 30mg daily. It can help with the inflammation. I think your derm did you a disservice by putting you on .025 tret. It is for mild acne. And I think they should have given you other medications to help (combo therapy). If you did not go to a derm and just started this tret on your own, you need to consider seeing one. You can even try Amazon one medical; they can give you additional medications to make this go away faster. If you can\u2019t afford a derm and want to do this on your own, you are going to need to up the frequency to get through this purge. Be sure to use a good moisturizer in the daytime. You can also try an otc Aza to ease some of the inflammation and the zinc tablets. If it gets too painful, take an aleve. I\u2019m sorry you are going through this. I do think accutane would be a faster solution, but I just wanted you to know it is possible to clear severe acne with tret and Aza. Tirtir Aza serum is very good, btw.",
      "It\u2019s very important to list how often you\u2019re applying, usual skin state and sensitivity, and what other products you\u2019re using. *On average people start off with 2-3 times a week, alternating every other day or every 2 days at 0.05% or 0.025% or less if skin is more sensitive. That should be done for 2-3 weeks before increasing gradually to every night or as tolerated and then to a higher percentage.* Moisturizing with products with good skin barrier repair ingredients is extremely important on top and especially under Tret. I use 100% Aloe Vera Gel for soothing and hydration under Aveeno Colloidal Oatmeal Cream, then 0.05% Tret Cream, then Aveeno Cream again. Right now Tret\u2019s every other day, so in between I\u2019ll do Aloe, Aveeno Cream, then occlude with Vaseline on top (Slugging) to hydrate and repair my skin between Tret nights until it gets used to it. *Purging (more acne coming to the surface faster) is normal when starting and typically lasts 1.5-3 months on average. If your skin doesn\u2019t typically breakout like this, that\u2019s likely what you\u2019re experiencing. So is peeling, dryness, and some redness. Cream tretinoin is better for dryness/dry skin than gel which is for oily. It\u2019s best to avoid other actives while you\u2019re starting.* So long as your skin is not painful, excessively red, dry, or peeling a lot there is nothing to worry about. This is likely just purging. Following the steps in the first paragraph is the best way to make the process go smoothly. Edit: People are mentioning Adapalene which is great if you\u2019re using Tret more so for Acne than anti-aging, and it\u2019s one of the least irritating Retinoids. More first line treatments for Acne though are actives like Salicylic Acid and Benzoyl Peroxide.",
      "Accutane. I was on Accutane for 3 months and it completely cleared my skin for more than a decade. I had a purge like this while on Retin-A and topical clindamycin, so when I began the Accutane, I didn\u2019t even experience purging. I looked in the mirror one day and saw clear, smooth skin with no visible pore. I had dry cracked corners of my lips the entire 3 months, but that was my only side-effect. It was a miracle for me. My acne started to resurface in my 30s, when I went back to college. I was prescribed spironolactone and it also cleared my skin in a relatively short amount of time. The spiro was significantly cheaper, but the Accutane was the better long-term cure. Now that I\u2019m much older, neither Accutane or spironolactone is indicated. I feel grateful to have been acne free for so many years, but I never imagined I\u2019d be facing this battle again in my 50s.",
      "This is approaching cystic. The truth is, pretty much nothing but Accutane will fully resolve it, at least in a short period of time. People here will praise Tretinoin as the cure for your acne but it really doesn\u2019t work for everyone. See your dermatologist. Edit: Everyone in the comments, while trying to help, isn\u2019t taking the right approach to this. I see so many people telling her to throw in many different acids and products on top of what she already has. You\u2019re not building a teen\u2019s skincare routine, this is a real medical condition that should be treated by a real dermatologist.",
      "Please give it time. Skin doesn\u2019t change fast unfortunately. Once you get up to every-other-day on this strength is when you will start to see a difference. Then you will be able to bump up to the next strength after a few months. When I hit 3x weekly of the 0.05 strength, my skin looked noticeably improved to where I\u2019ve had many compliments. I have a different problem, but have read the same experience from tons of people. In fact, my skin looks so good I stayed at every-other-day on that dose since. It\u2019s been a year and a half total for me doing the slow advances in strength & frequency."

The side effects (severely chapped lips\u2014like beyond chapped\u2014were my worst one) were totally worth it for me. I don\u2019t think anyone who hasn\u2019t lived with severe cystic acne can understand.",
      "Dude you need Accutane \u2026 don\u2019t let the horror stories scare you. You are already suffering so it won\u2019t seem as bad.",
      "I had acne that was around this bad or perhaps slightly better for three years. Tretinoin (especially at the low dose you're using it) is like dumping a bucket of water on an active forest fire. Accutane is a necessity in these situations. I was on it for several months and my acne has completely disappeared. Ask a dermatologist if you can go on Accutane.",
      "Aww love sorry to hear you are going through this. I went through this but worse. I also struggled with Tret and switched to a different version (Arazlo). I also had to start 50 mg of spironolactone. My doctor didn\u2019t want to go to accutane as it dries your whole body including your joints. Spironolactone 50 mg helped me",

You can also post in the weekly help thread - it's stickied to the top of the sub every week! Here are our tops tips for avoiding peeling: - Make sure your skin is completely dry when you apply tretinoin. Wet skin increases absorption and flaking! - Make sure your routine is hydrating enough. Hydrating toners like those from Hada Labo can really help - but remember not to layer hyaluronic acid directly under tretinoin. HA increases absorption, which in the case of tretinoin can cause extreme irritation, peeling, and flaking. /r/asianbeauty has many product recs. - A good moisturizer is key. Vanicream Lite, and Cerave are popular options. - A konjac sponge is a very gentle form of physical exfoliation that can really help! - Vaseline or Aquaphor can also really help prevent dryness. Pat on a very thin layer **after your tret has completely dried** - don't slather it, and don't layer on top of wet tret, just apply a thin layer on top. - Oil cleansing can work for many as a way to gently remove the excess skin. Get an emulsifying oil cleanser that will wash off easily (Hada Labo has a great one). - Consider skipping a night of tret if you have lots of peeling. Yes that may slow down your progress by a few days but a damaged moisture barrier can take months to recover. Go slow.

      "Beep boop! It looks like you'd like information about applying tretinoin around the eyes. While many people do apply tretinoin around their eyes, this can cause permanent damage to the oil glands in the eyes, and can result in permanently dry eyes. Remember that tretinoin travels up to 2\" below the skin, so you'll still get anti-aging benefits even if you don't apply right next to your eyes. Be safe, and protect your eyes: don't apply tretinoin near your eyes or on your eyelids.

I am, however, on this sub regularly and, although I know how important pushing through a purge is, I see a lot of examples that I couldn't have pushed through. This might be the worst/best I've seen and I know with 100% certainty that I'd have given up.

      "Routine: AM: *no cleanse, no water rinse, nothing.* I do not wash my face in the morning. Just go straight to applying moisturizer then sunscreen. When I tried washing twice per day my skin freaked out) - Vanicream HA + ceramides moisturizer - Sunscreen (lately Neutrogena oil free 55 SPF or Glossier invisible shield) PM: - Oil cleanse (currently L\u2019Occitane, usually Neutrogena or DHC) - Cleanse in shower *but* turn the water to cool when washing face (important) *- If using Tret or rest day: LRP hydrating gentle cleanser* *- If exfoliating: Peter Thomas Roth anti aging gel cleanser (more aggressive) or Cerave renewing SA cleanser (less aggressive)* - FAB ultra repair hydrating serum - Vanicream HA + ceramides moisturizer - Tret .025% cream - Cerave cream in the tub Thoughts & things I\u2019ve learned along the way: - Skin type: very oily, acne prone, hormonal acne mainly on cheeks and jawline - My routine has changed A LOT over the last 19 months, I\u2019ve tried soo many products and spent so much money lol only to come back to a pretty basic routine - Before Tret my skin type was NOT sensitive to anything at all, ever, now it is and I treat it as such. Tret will likely change your skin type, the protective outermost layer of skin is constantly exfoliated off - Started with .1% in May 2019 and actually, contrary to popular practice, worked my way all the way down to .025% where I find my skin is happiest and most calm - Stopped physical exfoliants altogether, and honestly most harsh acid leave ons, might do Krave kale-lalu-yAHA or Dr. Dennis Gross wipes once in a blue moon, I just prefer chemical acid cleansers if at all (per the above) - I avoid direct sun on my face as much as possible while still trying to live a normal life in Florida lol - I\u2019m consistent and dedicated to a routine but I also listen to my skin and respond to it\u2019s needs which do change from day to day so, as such, my routine varies a bit from day to day too as you can see. If I notice even the slightest sign of irritation, I back off completely. Not worth a damaged moisture barrier - I\u2019m only using Tret 2-3 times per week now, and taking 1-2 days entirely off of any actives - At one time I was using it 5-7 times per week but my skin was chronically tinted red then and eventually developed a dermatitis patch - At one point I took 2 months completely off of Tret (June ish of this year I think) in effort to resolve the stubborn dermatitis patch on my cheek and overall just feeling discouraged by that - Dropped down to .025% 2-3x/week after that and it hasn\u2019t come back and my skin is at it\u2019s best lately! :) - I never use any other actives on a Tret day - Left side of my face (last pic) is my \u201cbad/stubborn/more problematic\u201d side, I think bc it\u2019s the driver\u2019s window side? Anyone else feel this way? - Forehead never purged (just had lines and CCs there) but I still deal with cheek and jawline/hormonal acne here and there (and also chin/maskne sometimes) - I\u2019ve had zero facials/treatments/injections. Just Tret and at-home skincare - I never don\u2019t buffer. Sometimes I even put it on *after* Cerave cream in the tub. Putting Tret on dry skin goes against everything we\u2019ve literally ever learned about keeping moisture in the skin. Ridiculous advice imo lol (I did it for a while at first and skin was so tight and dry) - Less is more! Be gentle! Give your skin room to heal & thrive! - Less is more except when we\u2019re talking MOISTURE \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\ude02 take moisturizing very seriously, I\u2019m very heavy handed w/ that, Tret will make your skin dry - Apply moisturizer to damp skin - Non topical skincare related lifestyle factors that may or may not contribute: I\u2019m a dietitian I eat decent, I work out very consistently, manage and keep stress at bay (mostly), drink tons of water, get 7-8 hrs of sleep usually, very routine lifestyle overall, oh and I\u2019m on BC - I def use more than a pea size amount \ud83d\ude02 - NO PICKING! I was a bad picker/pimple popper before Tret. I\u2019m now religious about not touching my face AT ALL throughout the day - Sleeping on satin pillowcases, change them often - Impeccable mask hygiene \ud83d\ude37 - A lot of tears, fears, doubts surrounding this product and it\u2019s efficacy/worthiness between these photos. You are not alone in that! But most people give up longgg before the skin has a chance to transform - Be, and I can\u2019t stress this enough, GENTLE - Let your skin guide you, listen to its needs, it is live tissue that operates in a certain way and you need to work *with* that natural process not against it - Learn to be intuitive rather than rigid with your routine - When I stopped fussing and worrying about my skin so much, got into a better headspace about it, focused my attention on other areas in life, (while still staying consistent with my skincare in the background), time went by faster and next thing I knew my skin got clearer lol - And one of the most important things I almost forgot... pick something and STICK WITH IT! I didn\u2019t get results like this until I stuck to the same simple, basic routine for an extended time. Although it\u2019s temping, I always look a little red and irritated when constantly trying new products. Complaints before starting Tret were texture, uneven tone, closed comedones, fine lines, dullness, wanted dat GLOW and dat DEW y\u2019all!! After pics taken this week in same office and lighting, no filters, no editing/retouching/etc. Sorry guys check back for more bc I keep adding to the above list as I remember things! :) thank you all for your kind, kind words I\u2019m touched, truly!",
      "I'm sorry this is a late response but you've really inspired me. You look so radiant and beautiful. Posts like these genuinely make me feel so happy to witness people who have transcended their acne struggles and it fills me with such hope. Though my hormonal acne breakouts have lessened, I've considered quitting tretinoin, questioning its efficacy after all these years, yet in all likelihood I've just listened to the wrong advice and ignored my intuition. But I feel I'm getting closer to some sound, sensible conclusions here & realizing where I can course-correct yet again (also feels like a full circle) / make a few changes that you've highlighted in your journey (thanks so much for the detailed post - it is so insightful & affirming!), such as 1) stop leave-on exfoliants & switch to SA cleanser on off-tret days, 2) buffering before and packing on moisture after tret, plus maybe also an occlusive like CeraVe Healing Ointment (had you ever tried that when experiencing extra irritation?), 3) lowering from .1% to perhaps .05 or .025%, 4) and not sure but I've always wanted to resist AM cleansing and figure out a less is more approach like you have, maybe steps 1 - 3 will get me there. Though I'm curious to hear you don't even rinse with water, even after nights with tret? I convinced myself it needs to be rinsed off but maybe that's a misconception. Also lastly, sorry, but had you ever tried Vitamin C or niacinamide in your routine? Or did you rule them out?",

      "I'm thrilled to find someone who shares my passion for exfoliants! I've been on the tretinoin train for many years, just like you, but after 9 years, I noticed the results plateaued. It might have been psychological, but I'm convinced that incorporating peels and leave-on exfoliants took my anti-aging game to the next level! My go-to peels are MUAC's 40% mandelic acid peel and their 40% glycolic acid peel. I also love Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Peels. I typically pair them with a 14% glycolic acid leave-on exfoliant from Alpha Skincare. These exfoliating peels and leave-on serums have increased my anti-aging results tenfold. TIP: When shopping for exfoliants, make sure to look for products with a True Acid Value (TAV) label. This ensures you're getting the actual percentage of the acid, rather than just a percentage of the entire formula. For instance, a product claiming 5% lactic acid might only contain 2% of the actual acid. As a cosmetics insider, I've got some industry secrets to share. Let's just say I'm not a fan of certain brands (cough, The Ordinary, cough) that don't provide accurate labeling. But that's a topic for another time! Stay exfoliated, stay fabulous!",

It simplies my routine by exfoliating and cleansing in one step, reduces breakouts, and makes my face soft and smooth like a baby's butt. I can't use it as regularly in the winter as I have dry skin, but in all other seasons, I use it daily. You look great.",

      "Yes I say it\u2019s worth the try. Differin for me just made the acne come and go faster, good but still annoying. Never got out of the purge phase. So far tretinoin is smoothing my scars a little and the texture which makes it look better. But tretinoin is easily accessible to me $2usd. I\u2019d rather use tretinoin and shell out $2 and see what it can do (I\u2019m about to enter 4th month on tret, 12 months recommended for optimal results) before I spend thousands on lasers. Loving the texture of my skin so far. You\u2019re probably familiar with this kind of story, but I already spent a shit load on acne products over the years trying to get rid of the acne. Trying to make smarter moves now. I\u2019d say it\u2019s absolutely worth the try if it\u2019s not difficult for you to access. Just be aware you will probably still need some lasers at the end. But you\u2019ll probably decrease the amount of sessions of lasers you\u2019ll need. Where I\u2019m from that\u2019s saving thousands lol Also I did have a purge myself on tret, but they didn\u2019t scar like they usually do",
      "It definitely can help with scars. I usually tell people who have acne scars to try a year on Tret if they can. I don't think it will resolve everything or leave you with the results you desire, but it will give you some progress, and that progress is progress that you can obtain at a relatively cheap price since Tret isn't very costly. It's not just about the cost; when Tret is used correctly, it's not painful like some other treatments. After that year, you can reassess the situation and choose from the other options (or you can go for these right away if you do not want to wait). You can have a series of chemical peels before starting Tret. You will need Jessner X (X for Cross, meaning it will be layered with TCA) or TCA peels alone. These are potent peels, and you will likely have a few layers of each peel done (they wait 5 minutes after applying and apply some more). A series of 6-8 peels is usually required. This should be done by a professional because the risk of injury is high when you do not know what you're doing and working with these acids. They are not like the peels you can get at a drug store, like the 2% BHA, 25% AHA. You cannot mix Tret with these. Be warned. If you want to try peels and continue with Tret after a year, you will have to quit the Tret for a certain time before and after the peels for safety reasons. You can look at microneedling (done in a medical setting). Those rollers you can get for home use won't do much. This is going to be a series of 6-12 treatments. Laser resurfacing, subcision, Botox\u2014it all depends on what you and your doctor agree on. My best advice to you would be to try Tret for a good year (you get to see most of the results that Tret can offer within a year- this is not to say that it stops working after!). You may want to look into TCA peels before, but be warned that if money is a factor, a series of 6-8 is something that your wallet is going to feel. I would do a few peels, personally, because it will likely give some results and the Tretinoin (once you start it) will be working on layers of skin below where it would have worked before/if you didn't have the peels done). You can do it without the peels. I'm just treating you how I'd want to be treated if I were you. Another option would be to say screw it to all of that and to go for the 6-12 sessions of dermarolling. Again, this will end up being costly. When I say expensive, it's not in the tens of thousands, but expect at least 100$ (CAD) per treatment. Many factors will affect the price. If you live in a city with a lot of competition, you will likely pay hundreds of dollars less than I would in my rural area, where there is no competition. I want to say that if you want to go with Tret alone for a year, you should see results. I highly doubt all the scars would be gone, but some people are happy with the reduction in scars and feel confident with the few scars they have left.",
      "Your skin looks relatively clear, I think you should go straight for microneedling instead because tretinoin is not really able to help icepick scars",
      "Gold standard is co2 resurfacing laser. These cost approx $3k a session. Watch some videos to see the before and after. If I were you I would start tretinoin and as others say: give it a go for a year. After about 4 months if your skin is tolerating it well. Everyone is different. Then start\u2026 Home microneedling: Ideally the derminator (can be purchased online). A bit more pricy than the DR Pen M8s. Derminator is said to be superior. (Less painful/ more accurate in the needling/less drag). - watching videos on tik tok and you tube will explain how, what needles you need and how deep to go. Needle once a month. If not happy after a year with the progress: Then get a consult for co2."

      "Some of my favorite moisturizers are Eucerin with 5 % urea AM, Kiehl's ultimate face cream, Aestura atobarrier 365 cream (PM), Zerafite barrier repair (PM), Zerafite soothing and calming face cream (PM), LRP Triple (PM) and double repair, LRP cicaplast (more of an occlusive-PM and AM on cheeks if they feel dry-I found a way to apply under SPF with no pilling)). Occasionally, I throw in Vanicaerm during the day since it's light (summer this works better). All of these are in my regular rotation depending on what my skin needs. Elta MD reformulated my SPF elements tinted, so I have had a heck of a time finding SPF. That was my go to for years. It matched my skin perfectly and was so nice to reapply. I've tried almost everything. I prefer tinted since I don't wear face make up anymore. Many of them are too light for me (color wise). I reapply 2-3 times each day so it has to be a one that looks good with reapplications. So far the only thing I have found that I can consistently use that blends with my olive skin and plays well with all my moisturizers is Tizo 3 Primer and SPF mineral tinted sunscreen. I can use DRMTLGY SPF matte (summer) or the dewy tinted version (dewy is good for super dry months) as well. The color is a little off but my skin does like this one. Winer I can also use healthy skin labs tinted SPF since it's really hydrating and the color matches well (too dewy for summer). Non tinted SPFs I use. LRP double repair SPF on my neck and chest as well as LRP Athelios melt in milk, especially if it's a day I'm outside more(also on my forearms and hands). I also like Naturium for my neck, chest, hands, and forearms.",

      "Generally if you start using tret for the first time its 1. better to ease in with adapalene + topical clindamycin 2. use a lower percentage of tret, .025% is best for beginner use It\u2019s definitely purging but also damaged skin barrier, good to use ceramides or squalene during this time as it helps soothes and build back your skin barrier. if you feel like moisturizing is too much for your skin at the moment you could just use a very hydrating serum to make up for lost moisture. ALSO!! If you\u2019re experiencing purging its best to take actives out of your routine (ie: vit c) and for best sun protection find a tinted sunscreen that has titanium dioxide + zinc oxides (but if the sunscreen you\u2019re using is your favorite one just stick with it). Just noting on my personal experience although if you are to change up your skin care routine with new products i recommend changing 1 product after 3-4 months of use before introducing new one. ps: i think toner is unnecessary but it\u2019s entirely up to you!",

      "what moisturizer are you using? your son can become sensitive to certain ingredients like niacinamide, which are common in moisturizers, after starting in a retinoid. i'd try switching to an incredibly simple moisturizer like the vanicream lotion and see if it burns then. if it still burns when using vanicream lotion, or you're already using a very basic moisturizer and are experiencing burning, it's likely you've mildly damaged your skin barrier. imo you can continue using tretinoin whole trying to heal it, but in that case, i would nix the benzoyl peroxide and try only washing your face with water in the morning. use a rich moisturizer and also maybe slug over it on days where you're not using tretinoin, to give your skin the optimal conditions to recover and heal. if you're on a higher concentration of tret or are using the gel formulation, id recommend speaking to your dermatologist about going down in strength and/or switching to the cream, both of which would be gentler on your skin. you can always attempt moving back up in strength and/or switching back to gel once your skin has acclimated to a less harsh version",
      "It sounds like your barrier is compromised. You have a couple of options. First, I would remove the benzoyl peroxide from your routine and get a different spf. Second, I would add a hydrating toner in the am. Third, I would buffer your tretinoin with a light moisturizer, and only increase frequency once you can use treat without irritation. I would stop using tret until your barrier calms down, and you are used to the new spf and toner.",

      "So tret doesn't directly treat hyperpigmentation, it speeds up skin turnover so over a long period of time you'll see improvement with new skin showing u,p but not that drastic. You need tyrosine inhibitors like azaelic acid, trnaexmic acid, or vitamin c to really fight pigmentation. I'd recommend adding in prescription-strength AZA and working up to every day on tret, or increasing the strength. Actually, I see a difference in the intensity of your spots and the overall texture, looking a bit smoother. I think it's hard for you to see, but I def see some improvements. Additionally, for pigmentation, you really need a tinted sunscreen spf 50 in the sun to avoid worsening of dark spots. Visible light affects pigmentation. I recommend getting the Elta MD tinted sunscreen or the Drmtlgy one, for best results. Shielding from the sun is important for pigmentation, as UV triggers melanocytes. For pitted scars, microneedling and lasers work faster, I'd as the derm about those or go to an esthetician.",
      "If you're trying to improve the pitting it will likely take a year or so of tret use, and even then you're talking mild improvement only. If you want more dramatic and faster results you're better off having some laser resurfacing sessions - probably with co2 laser here. (Still use tret of course) Save up, don't give up.",
      "Yes, increase your every night and also get SPF50. SPF30 isn\u2019t enough if you\u2019re struggling with hyperpigmentation. But before you increase tret to every night, start applying tret before moisturizer, not after. Tub Vanicream is super thick and is likely blocking too much tret from working."

      "Hi, I've recently started using the aeropress I bought 5+ years ago. I've mostly drank keurig and nespressos since I stopped drinking tims and drip coffee. Basics of what I have going hardware wise is a sboly conical 19 grind setting grinder, a crappy kettle that I've recently cleaned with vinegar and rinsed very thoroughly at the start of this journey. The first bag of beans I decided to buy was a washed Ethiopian with tasting note of rose, peach lemonade, and apricot jam. From what I gather, this would be higher in acidity, less bitter, lighter flavor than almost anything, or the lightest I've ever had before. Am I correct in saying that acidity can come off as sour to underdeveloped pallets? This brings me to the grinder. The grinder was given to me with some beans still in the hopper. I tried a cup of that from the areopress and it was extreamly sour. I'm guessing this is due to the old age of the beans and being out in the open in the hopper for likely months. I cleaned out the grinder what I knew I could at the time, I didn't want to break it. I started using the bad of beans I bought and it was coming out very sour still. I this reduced over the next few cups as the old stuff came out more. Then I got more brave and discovered how to open it up and remove the top burr and was able to clean it out a lot better using a air can to use on computers to blow stuff out even better. I've ended up reducing the grind setting to 4 from the finest. For my brew method with the aeropress, as you may have guessed, im using the James Hoffmann method. I'm doing 12g coffee 200g ish usually a bit more because I'm bad at pouring but never less. 2min wait, swirl to break the crust, 30s wait, press gently and slowly aim for 30s press time. The water I've been using has been boiling on the bottom of the kettle as I pour, as I think you want as hot as you can for light roast? I'm using carbon filtered water from an aqua gear filter. Now with the grinder as clean as I think I can get it with what I think is a good grind setting and I think a good technique, its still a bit sour. This sour is far far more enjoyable than that of the old leftover bean. I've run around 200g of this new bean thru the grinder so far. My question is, might the sourness I'm tasting be from the bean selection and the roast? Or might I need to do an even deeper clean of the grinder? Maybe I'm messing up a step somewhere else? Maybe I'm doing everything right and it's all hunky dory? Thanks! Edit: I should add that before I received this grinder that I got a bag from a local roaster and had them grind it for me fresh. It was a medium roast with surprisingly no mention of anything on the bag other than their name. It was fairly coarsely ground like coarser than folders I'd say. I did tell them I'd be using an areopress and they said their grinder had a button for that so I dunno. Anyway the point of this is that there was no sourness coming from that bag at all and it was definitely more of the traditional dark earthy coffee kind of flavor.",
      "I want to make better coffee, but I don't truly know where to begin, because I think I treat it differently to most coffee drinkers. I currently have been using ground coffee in a moka pot that I got as a gift from work for my five-year anniversary. [This guy.](https://www.amazon.com/London-Sip-Stainless-Stove-Top-Percolator/dp/B09X1ZJKMP) As a way to occasionally make one single cup of coffee, it works for me. I don't drink coffee regularly and only brew for one of three reasons: I decide to make one because I decide I would like the caffeine or I just feel like having a coffee; I am making mixed drinks (like espresso martinis or carajillos) and need it; or I have a guest who asks for some. However, relying on pre-ground coffee hasn't been ideal. I brew it so irregularly (maybe once or twice a month) that the grounds just sit around in an airtight bag for a long time. I also have some nice beans I've picked up on travel that I want to make the most of, so I bought [the hand grinder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXZACFB) recommended in the wiki here that's under $50. Which circles back to the moka pot. I like how it works, and its ease--I fill the reusable filter with grounds, and the bottom cavity with water. And then I just leave it on a burner until the coffee is finished brewing. But I also find a lot of the time it's burned my coffee despite me following the directions directly, and the build quality, while fine, feels cheap and unlikely to last. Should I replace the moka pot? What should I do about the coffee getting burned?",

Everybody on Reddit is praising the SM-S mugs, but I've not heard anything about the SV thermoses. Does anybody have experience with the SV-G or SM-Z lines and could share their thoughts? Are they as good at keeping temperature as the more popular mugs? Would it be comfortable to drink straight out of an SV-GR (for example, in a car, where pouring into the cup is not ideal)?",

Sibarist filters are unsustainably expensive, so it would be nice to compromise on price with other filters that are better than Melitta filters.

After replacement, I had to completely readjust the grind to get espresso. I mean I had to detach and reattach the adjustment handle 3 times, as I couldn't go fine enough with the range it was set to pre-replacement. I blew through 500g of coffee making small adjustments before I eventually emptied the chamber and just dialled backwards from the burrs chirping. Two questions: 1. Is it normal for the grind to be so far out after burr replacement? It felt like I could have made a cafetiere coffee with what came out immediately after replacement 2. Should I be worried about burr alignment now, or is the e37s design fairly robust in eliminating misalignment? Thanks in advance and looking forward to exploring the sub \ud83d\ude4f"

      "If you can have a space (I'm assuming this is at a workplace), buy an electric tea kettle. Get a pour over single cone and make your coffee fresh. The difference is notable between fresh coffee and coffee that's been in a thermos for hours. At least it is to me. If you don't notice the difference or taking a few minutes here and there to make a fresh mug isn't an option, get the best thermos you buy. Nearly every review rates the Stanley classic #1, with Zojirushi a close contender.",
      "Yep, keeping coffee on a hot plate can make it taste bitter over time. Best option is a good insulated thermos (like Zojirushi or Fellow). Avoid reheating, and preheat your mug or flask to keep it warm longer without burning the flavor. Ember mugs work too if you're okay with the price!",
      "I do a few things. I use a well insulated cup and add cream (whole milk). That\u2019s about the best you can do. Cream stabilizes flavor. Some cup warmers exist and I suppose you could do that. I think overall, if you plan to drink warm coffee that\u2019s sat for over three hours, you might want to go for the tea bags of coffee and just steep them in hot water.",
      "Preheat your mug or best to put it in an insulated tumbler and preheat that tumbler or thermos as well. By preheat I mean pour in some boiled water to slow down the reduce of temperature once you put in the coffee. You know why coffee shops tend to put their mugs on top of the espresso machine? Because that place also works as a cup warmer.",

      "My experience won\u2019t be 100% transferable because my machine is in a very busy home environment but still sharing as I think my research is relevant for you. When I renovated my house I wanted to install a commercial machine as we go through way more volume than a normal home (longer story for another day but I often get asked by my roaster if I\u2019m running a small cafe\u2026). I ended up shopping synesso hydra, LM strada, and slayer against each other. I live in the Seattle area so am close to all three HQs (US vs global HQ for LM) and have good techs nearby for all three machines. I have a number of friends who are coffee professionals and got to speak to shops that run all three machines. Slayer stood out for lack of reliability and I crossed them off early. I have since heard that their reliability has improved and more shops are running them again. Between LM and Synesso reliability seems similar and the techs/shop owners I spoke to say service calls and parts availability are equal between the machines so that is a largely a wash. If counter space is a premium the Strada is a couple inches deeper than a Hydra- that was a real issue for me even in a larger home kitchen. From a Barista standpoint the Synesso seems to win. Shot pulling is similar but many folks told me their steaming wands are the best. One other thing that stood out- not that you\u2019d have to be talking to corporate very often but the Synesso team is awesome. I\u2019ve reached out a few times with questions and during the buying process and they were super cool about talking with me and psyched that someone was excited about their machines. Same for the Slayer team when I was researching. The LM team really didn\u2019t want to be bothered. Even though I can literally walk to their showroom they gave me the stiff arm and said go talk to a reseller, so that was a very different experience. My volume is nothing like a shop but my machine has done great now about 3 years in. I do outsource annual maintenance which is about $200 for an hour of labor plus consumables, again that would happen more frequently in commercial service.",
      "Having a good water filtration system that can be measured and is well monitored is the best preventative maintenance for any brand machine. After that, actual direct routine preventative maintenance will keep things running well. Definitely make sure to sign up for regular maintenance. Buy from a local technician company if you have the option. Emergency repairs and rush work do not spark joy for anyone. A tech company will be interested in preventing stressful situations for themselves and your shop by keeping you on a regular PM schedule. They might steer you towards the brand they like working on and have the parts for but they probably won't shy away from new stuff. Do the boring pragmatic water and preventative maintenance stuff so that you can make the passionate choice to get an awesome espresso machine that you actually want. Get the machine that is the most fun to look at, operate, talk about, and that makes the best bean juice! You probably know the answer you want already and you narrowed it down to two brands. But don't overlook that third brand that keeps sneaking its way into this conversation. You can totally get that other brand if you take maintenance seriously.",
      "Agree with most of everything that's been posted so far but I will say I despise the LM grouphead design with the gicleurs and excessive number of small copper tubes and fittings. The Synesso design seems a lot more elegant is a lot easier to service in that particular area.",
      "every issue you've had on a LM is going to be present on a Synesso. They are built with staggeringly similar internal builds (which makes sense when you realize that Synesso was founded by former LM employees) The one that will last longer and have fewer problems is the one that you or a local tech feels comfortable doing preventative maintenance on. If the local tech company carries Synesso steam wand rebuild kits but needs to special order La Marzocco ones, you should buy a Synesso. If vice versa you should buy a La Marzocco."

I still see many people are interested in coffee reviewers, regardless it's not meaningful for coffee geeks/nerds. here's the thing, most of the coffee drinkers are just casual drinkers that probably can't tell the difference between different batches of same coffee. while there are great blends that are pretty consistent, I don't think people are looking for notes in coffee that shows up when you brew as espresso, but doesn't when you brew with v60, let's say. they simply wonder well-known coffee blends, sometimes even local blends to have review and see what people think I was wondering what's your final thought on this?",
      "I recently purchased 5 lbs of Ethiopia Anaerobic Worka Sakaro whole beans from Rooster Roaster and plan to split them evenly with a friend, 2.5 lbs each. I\u2019ve read that anaerobic processed beans often benefit from a rest period of about 2-3 weeks after roasting to fully develop their flavors. Based on that, here\u2019s my tentative preservation plan, and I\u2019d really appreciate your thoughts or suggestions: 1. Open the 5 lb bag and split it evenly\u20142.5 lbs each. 2. Transfer my 2.5 lbs into an airtight (but not vacuum-sealed) container, and let it rest for 2 weeks at room temperature in a cool, dark place. 3. After resting, divide the beans into 20g portions (around 57 batches), and vacuum-seal each batch in individual sealer bags. 4. Freeze about 40 batches. Keep the remaining 17 batches at room temperature to consume first. 5. Use one batch per day for the first 17 days. 6. Once I begin thawing the frozen batches, I\u2019ll thaw them one at a time, only as needed. If I notice that the flavor continues to improve day by day (i.e., with longer post-roast rest), I may start pulling some batches out of the freezer earlier and let them rest a few extra days at room temperature before using. This is the plan I\u2019ve formed based on research and recommendations I\u2019ve read about freezing coffee beans. Would this approach work well for preserving flavor and freshness? Any suggestions for improving it would be greatly appreciated.",

      "This is awesome, if my kid ever makes me coffee for my birthday, she\u2019s getting some sort of huge reward (she\u2019s a newborn though, so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s she\u2019s gonna like in 13 years). You\u2019re a good son. Now, my opinion: go to a nice coffee shop (or a Starbucks if there aren\u2019t nicer shops around you), and shell out the $15 for a pound of good coffee. The barista will ask you if you want it ground, and you can say yes, for french press, BUT, I\u2019d advise that you ask for one click finer than french press. If your french press is the common one that\u2019s about 10 inches tall, that\u2019s an 8-cup press (they mean 8 small af cups though because it makes 4 at best). If you have a kitchen scale: weigh down about 70g of coffee and put those in. Next up, boil some water and wait about 2 minutes after it boils and you take it off the heat source so that it is right under boiling temperature (you want around 200 degrees F; water boils at 212). With the coffee in the scale add another 840g of water, which is the same as 840 ml. That gives you a 1:12 ratio of coffee to water, which makes a pretty decent cup, according to mostly everyone. If you DON\u2019T have a scale: no problem. This is easier, still makes a really good cup of coffee and you\u2019re not sacrificing anything except for consistency. If you\u2019re doing this as a one-time treat for mom, you\u2019re still golden. Take a tablespoon from your kitchen (you\u2019re definitely bound to have those), and add 8 spoonfuls of the coffee to the press. Do the same \u201cjust below boiling\u201d thing with the water and fill it up until the point where the upper metal edge of the press is. After you do either of the above, give it a stir (careful\u2014a metal spoon can break glass pretty easily so be gentle), and wait 4 minutes. Don\u2019t let it go past 5. Grab that same spoon, scoop out any chunks of coffee grounds that floated to the top, and toss them out. Then, take the plunger, and slowly push it down. Bam, you just made coffee. Ask your mom for a sip so you can taste your creation and prepare for the inevitability of massive clumps of hair growing out of your chest immediately after you do this. Good luck! EDIT: caught a typo, and many thanks for the silver, unknown benefactor! EDIT 2: OK OK 840g = 800ml! I was sleepy, my bad. And thanks for the gold, kind stranger!",

With some practice, you can make delicious coffees in 5 minutes",
      "Dude, love it. I'm likely too late here for your mom's birthday, but a few small tips that I didn't see mentioned in the top comments (I didn't go through every one). A few bonus \"ideals\" - you don't have to do these, but it will take it up a notch or two more. 1. Find a local coffee shop, and ask if they sell locally roasted beans. If they do, ask for the most recent roasted ones. If you go to starbucks, they're going to be overroasted (burnt) and likely a month or two old. You may not think that it matters that much - but, if you get a medium roast bean that has been roasted within the last week (ideally), then you'll almost be able to convince non-coffee drinkers to start drinking it. 2. I get some people suggested have the whole bag ground at the coffee shop, and if you don't have a grinder available, then that's fine. But, a lot of the flavor escapes within the first hour or so of grinding, and more of the bitterness starts to come out. So, ideally, if you have a grinder available, grind it just before making it. If you have fresh roasted beans, and freshly ground, then when you add the hot water, you'll see it start to bubble and foam like this: [https://images.app.goo.gl/9GE71MFx1G6V2QRM6](https://images.app.goo.gl/9GE71MFx1G6V2QRM6) or [https://images.app.goo.gl/Qb96od6VWT2nAhxe8](https://images.app.goo.gl/Qb96od6VWT2nAhxe8) If it does that, you'll know you've got a good, fresh cup of coffee on the way, and it can't get much better than that.",
      "This is super sweet and I wish you good luck. I hope you follow some of the simpler advice here. FYI for buying the beans at the store, some places (like whole foods) let you buy coffee loose, meaning you could buy just a few scoops of nice stuff, or flavored stuff if your mom likes that, instead of a whole bag. And I bet an employee could help you set the grinder correctly for the French press. Asking the people here how to make coffee is like asking a nerd how to get to the nerd store. Edit: changed \"let you buy in bulk\" because OP doesn't need a bulk order of coffee",
      "2oz coffee ground for French press. (5-6 of the standard 2tbsp coffe scoops. Our you can do 10-12 tbsp) 1L water just under boiling. (Full but not too the tip top you need to put the lid on and push the plunger in) Pour water over beans, let sit for about 4 minutes Push plunger down slowly and pour into cups. Anything she'd like to add can be mixed into the cup itself. Coffee can be looked at as an exact science but it can also be very good with less precise measurements. Its not like the coffee will taste like junk if you are off by a little. The exact ratios are all personal taste, the isn't once that's right and one that's wrong, so measuring exactly is a good way to invite what YOU like, and it is a marathon not a sprint. If you use something close to the ratios I gave, and most other people are in the same ball park, I'm sure your mom will love it."

It's all about starting with decent (seriously, no need to break the bank on Kona microlot for each roast) green coffee, roasting it APPROPRIATELY for the origin and profile you like, and brewing it nicely when it's still at its peak. I have had Kona that I paid $20/lb for unroasted that was great, but far more often I will have a Colombia, Yemen, Kenya, or Sulawesi from a smallish farm that BLOWS MY MIND for $4/lb. My favorite coffee that I have ever had - and this includes pour-overs from places like Intelligentsia - was a Colombia, Narino (Inga Mystique) that I roasted on my porch and brewed with a kalita dripper.

      "I love the process too. But I find filter far more forgiving than espresso. I heard someone say that espresso is making coffee on a knife edge as there is much that can go wrong!! A V60 is relaxing in comparison. Once you have method down - decent water, decent coffee and a decent uniform grind - you will get a good result. Machines don\u2019t take the fun away per se, like a Moccamaster there is still fiddling - weighing, grinding, water, quick stir. It just helps if you are making coffee in higher volume. But if you are making 1-2 cups I totally love the hands on approach and will opt for clever / V60 / aeropress every time. Good luck on your coffee journey.",
      "I actually made a relevant reply earlier that I'm just going to copy and paste: I think practicing mindfulness in the morning is really important, so it isn't even just the taste of coffee for me. Weekdays are tough because I need to get to work fairly early (I'm not a morning person so needing to be somewhere 7:30am is brutal), but on the weekends it's important to me that I brew with my siphon brewer and have a nice cup in my kitchen by the window and just not have any electronics distracting me lol. Its been really enjoyable. My puppies play under my feet while I brew and sit by my stool as I drink. I try to be grateful for how perfect that is. I wouldn't change a single thing about it. Kind of hard to explain the feeling of having a nice cup of coffee, seeing the steam rise from it, smelling like a coffee shop, two perfect puppies at my feet, and seeing the light of a new day between the pine trees in my backyard this time of year. A ritual like that is one of the key factors that has helped depression and made my days productive by starting them early and positively",
      "Oh yeah. I'm all about the ritual and the surrounding culture. Definitely. I've been in recovery for 5 years, and with my using and alcoholism there were so many rituals, and working in restaurants there was so much of an alcohol culture. I managed a high end restaurant with a a huge bar. I loved creating the new cocktail menus, meeting with all of the wine reps, and ordering in all of the liquor. One of the reasons I got so into coffee after I got sober, was to find a healthy replacement to obsess over. I love grinding beans. I love trying out a new pour over technique. I love reading all about the new coffee I just got, and trying it out with 3 or 4 different brew methods. I love reading all of the online resources and subscribing to coffee magazines. The ritual of coffee is everything to me.",
      "I enjoy it for many reasons. Gives me a few minutes to slow down and think. Probably most of all is that it's something I get to solely enjoy the fruits of my efforts or share with those I choose. I enjoy my career, however the products I make are kept by my clients and the money I receive goes to bills, debts, my ex-wife, the government etc. However when I make coffee, its entirely for me and my companions. One of the few things that isn't taken from me. Therefore it inspires me to make it the best I can. Bonus points when I get to enjoy it outside sitting in the shade on a warm day (or in the sunlight during a cold day) and just savor it a few minutes listening to the birds sing or if I am traveling on the road enjoying it while I drive.",
      "Making coffee for me is like 50% for the coffee 50% for the ritual. I like to keep my hands busy and fidget and whatnot and making coffee really satisfies that need for me. I make myself a pour over in the morning and then throughout the day I make myself and the people in my household a variety of shots of espresso and espresso based drinks. I often think about how lucky I am that I live with 3 other people that also really enjoy coffee. I definitely think you would like preparing espresso if you're into the ritualistic aspect. Preparing espresso (for me at least) is a process that normally looks almost identical every time. On top of that, there are a lot of little steps in the preparation process that really make it fun and satisfying."

Best thing we did was put the drip closer to the cashier shave at we saved a few seconds pouring. To be honest the time you'd save is negligible. Though those drinks may take a long time to make, they take exactly five extra seconds to take and you usually receive your drip immediately while a separate person preps shots and milk. So it's not exactly a crazy shift.",
      "There is a shorter line for coffee. It\u2019s your local coffee bar. When I was visiting my sister, I\u2019d walk to the local shop. As I did, I passed a Starbucks with a drive through. The line contained a dozen or more cars waiting for their turn. I\u2019d go to the local shop, enjoy a nice cup, and walked back past that Starbucks. I was taken how silly this was. There\u2019s a great coffee shop two blocks away with way better coffee, shorter line, and a nice environment. All you have to do is be willing to get out of your dang car. A few days passing this Starbucks, I started realizing that many of the cars I saw in line on my way to my shop were still there on my way back! I had gone to my shop, ordered my coffee. Sat down, relaxed, read the news, talked to a few people, and got a nice morning walk in. These guys were still waiting for \u201ccoffee\u201d. I don\u2019t want to be snobbish. People like what they like. If you really don\u2019t like the flavor of coffee, a 20 ounce cup with three different shots of syrup, a mountain of whipped cream, and drizzled with caramel might be your thing. But, there are plenty of true coffee shops around. I even found a nice place in Dunedin, Florida, the town that answers the question, \u201cHey where can I find a drink around here?\u201d (Answer: About four feet to your left no matter where you\u2019re standing). I\u2019ve never waited more than five minutes for coffee in any shop no matter how busy. And all the shops I\u2019ve been to make a nice pot of drip for a very reasonable price sitting right by the cash register. This isn\u2019t a hate on Starbucks. You like what you like. But, I\u2019d never go to a Starbucks, not because the coffee is bad, but because I don\u2019t want to wait 20 minutes for a lousy cup of coffee. You almost always have options.",

However, I think you're more talking about the more common scenario where you have a cashier taking orders and one or more baristas making them. I assume that from this quote: >...and they usually pour it right there. The time it takes to order a non-fat vanilla latte with extra foam, for example, is hardly longer than the time it takes to order a 12 oz. black coffee. In fact, the extra 30 seconds for the cashier to get a cup and serve your coffee makes your ordering time longer. All that leads me to wonder what makes your order special? You're not waiting for other drinks to be made - just to place your order. You still get your drink before the mocha with coconut milk and no whip cream that was ordered before you. I see no reason why there should be a separate line for that.",

May not be doing some beans much justice if they shine in a pourover. I rotated the following subscriptions since 12/3/16: Mistobox, LA Coffee Club, Three Thousand Thieves (Australia), KaffeBox (Norway), Square Mile (London), Four Barrel, Verve, Counter Culture. Absolute best price of all and solid beans is Counter Culture at 4.4 cents/gram. Winner of most consistent high quality and relatively best value are tied with Verve/Square Mile, both 5.8 cents/gram shipped, which is impressive since Square Mile is airmailed from England. Least impressive quality was 3TT, which also happened to be most expensive due to shipping from Australia, total cost of 9 cents/gram. Most flexible is definitely Mistobox, but even though they have many suppliers, you are still technically limited. They have great customer service and will arrange whatever coffee you see on a supplier\u2019s website for your next shipment. They also have the best website experience by far. Worst website experience for account management is Kaffebox.no or 3TT. Most intriguing coffee is LA Coffee Club. Some coffees were stellar, others were average. Very wide variety of coffee shops and quality in their rotation from greater LA. Coolest coffee packaging is probably Kaffebox, although 3TT includes actual pictures from inside the coffeeshops or roasters that the beans come from, along with a nice write-up pamphlet of the roaster. I would have different recommendations for someone depending on what exactly they're trying to accomplish. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.",

It sounds like a great idea, though quite potent- so, like weed chocolate it would make sense to have a little piece daily and hopefully the flavor in the bar would hold over time.",

      "Very nice! I\u2019m an amateur chocolate maker and have been making fun variations like this to sell. Look at Chocolate Alchemy for all of your scientific needs, and for a variety of cacao nibs if you choose to go that route. Regarding conching and flavor, there is definitely a change in flavor for how long and how hot the mass is heated. Also, I\u2019ve noticed with many of my chocolate bar, the flavor changes as the bar is aged. It seems to stabilize after a week or so but in some instances my acidic notes are amplified. If you get a sous vide, you can make \u201ccocoa butter silk\u201d which is tempering cocoa butter itself at 92-93 F to only form the correct crystals. This can be added directly to chocolate mass at 90-92 F to temper immediately after mixing. Please try to play around with natural cocoa butter as well. I think you\u2019ll find it lends a wonderful background cocoa note without being specifically chocolatey."

I have similar issues with stimulants (I'm sure it has nothing to do with taking mysterious substances at raves for years) but sometimes it's just not at all enjoyable. However I love the taste. So I'm always keeping my eyes peeled for a good Swiss Water Process or low acid decaf. While I've tried a few single origins, I lean towards blends for decaf because they tend to have a more complete flavor profile. In my experience, roasters prioritize regular coffee over decaf and even some of the better roasters I've caught slacking on single origin decafs that have come across as flat and lacking body. A local roast I like for a rich, dark, diner style morning cup of decaf is First Light Blend by Grounds For Change. It's not SWP, but still water process, fair trade, organic and shade grown. But I'd drink it without those certifications even because it simply tastes delicious by itself or with any additions for your not-so-purist family and company.",

I will sip my partner\u2019s coffee on occasion and I\u2019m happy to say I really like my decaf over his regular most of the time! Some warnings when we re-enter the real world: 1. Always double check that it\u2019s decaf if they don\u2019t explicitly say \u201cand here\u2019s your decaf\u201d - usually about once a month I get a coffee that isn\u2019t decaf and it ruins my day (heart thumping, stomach turning, throat burning, and severe ADD). 2.

If I try to have two, or half cup later in the day, or anything extra other than that one morning cup, I'll get shakes and all of that. I can never drink coffee by itself. I must have something sweet with it. Bread with jam, pastry or cake. It has to have some bread and some sweet. Otherwise I'm toast. Also I have to eat a snack two hours later, something with protein and sweet (I usually have protein bars with raisins). So I have my system. I think the coffee drops the blood sugar a lot. That's why you're having sweats and shakes? For me as long as I have enough around to eat, I can have coffee. I have decaf in the house and was trying that in the afternoon, but it just didn't thrill me after having the one regular cup in the morning. Also, there was a period of time where I couldn't have ANY coffee. It would do really bad things to me, so I just stopped. Then years later, I smelled my husband's morning coffee and thought it smelled so good. I tried small cups at first then I was okay again!

      "This is hard to read, but i appreciate all the love being shown here because they\u2019ve been through a disaster of a year. I work for a roaster who pursues similar deals, and I personally negotiate these kinds of contracts often. Something I\u2019m not seeing here in the comments though, is an understanding of the level of risk the roaster was willing to take on in this story. I don\u2019t believe they were grifted, and I don\u2019t think they were blindsided by this, but I do think they took a risk and it went horribly. The contract made it clear what the risk was, just like putting $215,000 in the stock market, there\u2019s a few different ways it could have gone at the outset. I work for an extremely financially conservative coffee roaster, meaning we don\u2019t take these kinds of risks, and really it\u2019s annoying how few risks we take. When I set up these kinds of huge deals, I get dollar signs in my eyes, but then the owners reel me back and remind me we don\u2019t take risks and need to make sure the contract works for us no matter what. So, we have to push our distributors or resellers for up-front payment or shorter/faster payment terms in our contracts - I often feel bad pressing for these things in negotiations like we\u2019re annoying them asking for payment earlier than their other vendors ask for, but to my surprise we usually get something that benefits us, more than they initially offered and we mitigate risk. We also often withhold next deliveries until payment for the previous delivery goes through. I am the middle person in these conversations with large customers and, as bad as I feel pressing them for payments, or withholding further orders, I\u2019m thankful that we simply don\u2019t take these kinds of risks when I see how badly it can go. I\u2019m heartbroken for the whole community around this roaster because it likely means a lot of folks making less money this year than planned, and a lot of lessons learned for future deals\u2026but also I think these cases are gonna sell out just fine (unlike if they lost it all in the stock market). For other small roaster retailers and wholesale reps out there: no deal is worth this kind of risk.",

      "Hi, I've recently started using the aeropress I bought 5+ years ago. I've mostly drank keurig and nespressos since I stopped drinking tims and drip coffee. Basics of what I have going hardware wise is a sboly conical 19 grind setting grinder, a crappy kettle that I've recently cleaned with vinegar and rinsed very thoroughly at the start of this journey. The first bag of beans I decided to buy was a washed Ethiopian with tasting note of rose, peach lemonade, and apricot jam. From what I gather, this would be higher in acidity, less bitter, lighter flavor than almost anything, or the lightest I've ever had before. Am I correct in saying that acidity can come off as sour to underdeveloped pallets? This brings me to the grinder. The grinder was given to me with some beans still in the hopper. I tried a cup of that from the areopress and it was extreamly sour. I'm guessing this is due to the old age of the beans and being out in the open in the hopper for likely months. I cleaned out the grinder what I knew I could at the time, I didn't want to break it. I started using the bad of beans I bought and it was coming out very sour still. I this reduced over the next few cups as the old stuff came out more. Then I got more brave and discovered how to open it up and remove the top burr and was able to clean it out a lot better using a air can to use on computers to blow stuff out even better. I've ended up reducing the grind setting to 4 from the finest. For my brew method with the aeropress, as you may have guessed, im using the James Hoffmann method. I'm doing 12g coffee 200g ish usually a bit more because I'm bad at pouring but never less. 2min wait, swirl to break the crust, 30s wait, press gently and slowly aim for 30s press time. The water I've been using has been boiling on the bottom of the kettle as I pour, as I think you want as hot as you can for light roast? I'm using carbon filtered water from an aqua gear filter. Now with the grinder as clean as I think I can get it with what I think is a good grind setting and I think a good technique, its still a bit sour. This sour is far far more enjoyable than that of the old leftover bean. I've run around 200g of this new bean thru the grinder so far. My question is, might the sourness I'm tasting be from the bean selection and the roast? Or might I need to do an even deeper clean of the grinder? Maybe I'm messing up a step somewhere else? Maybe I'm doing everything right and it's all hunky dory? Thanks! Edit: I should add that before I received this grinder that I got a bag from a local roaster and had them grind it for me fresh. It was a medium roast with surprisingly no mention of anything on the bag other than their name. It was fairly coarsely ground like coarser than folders I'd say. I did tell them I'd be using an areopress and they said their grinder had a button for that so I dunno. Anyway the point of this is that there was no sourness coming from that bag at all and it was definitely more of the traditional dark earthy coffee kind of flavor.",
      "I want to make better coffee, but I don't truly know where to begin, because I think I treat it differently to most coffee drinkers. I currently have been using ground coffee in a moka pot that I got as a gift from work for my five-year anniversary. [This guy.](https://www.amazon.com/London-Sip-Stainless-Stove-Top-Percolator/dp/B09X1ZJKMP) As a way to occasionally make one single cup of coffee, it works for me. I don't drink coffee regularly and only brew for one of three reasons: I decide to make one because I decide I would like the caffeine or I just feel like having a coffee; I am making mixed drinks (like espresso martinis or carajillos) and need it; or I have a guest who asks for some. However, relying on pre-ground coffee hasn't been ideal. I brew it so irregularly (maybe once or twice a month) that the grounds just sit around in an airtight bag for a long time. I also have some nice beans I've picked up on travel that I want to make the most of, so I bought [the hand grinder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXZACFB) recommended in the wiki here that's under $50. Which circles back to the moka pot. I like how it works, and its ease--I fill the reusable filter with grounds, and the bottom cavity with water. And then I just leave it on a burner until the coffee is finished brewing. But I also find a lot of the time it's burned my coffee despite me following the directions directly, and the build quality, while fine, feels cheap and unlikely to last. Should I replace the moka pot? What should I do about the coffee getting burned?",

I\u2019m looking for a drip coffee maker that can replicate the taste and quality of a good pour-over as closely as possible. I still enjoy making pour-overs myself, but with a growing family, it\u2019s getting harder to find the time in the mornings. Naturally, a high-quality cup is important to me, but we also often brew just a single cup, and the Breville Precision Brewer seems to handle that better than many others. I\u2019m also interested in the cold brew feature since my wife loves it, but prepping cold brew for her is starting to feel like a chore. Are there any other machines out there that offer similar versatility? Or even ones that only excel at either single-cup brewing or pour-over-style quality, but produce such a superior cup that they\u2019d be worth considering instead?",
      "Hi, Recently picked up an EC885 and have a couple of questions for the more experienced users. The manual is somewhat lacking when it comes to how much coffee/milk to use. It came with a Pressurised 1 or 2 shot portafilter and I also picked up a bottomless 2 shot portafilter (looking on YouTube bottomless was the way to go) I guess how much coffee/milk is down to personal taste, but I would like a good starting place. Cheers.",
      "I'm sure this has been covered elsewhere on some other thread here, but I recently started using Sibarist fast trapezoid filters for my Clever Dripper, and I don't think I can go back to Melitta filters. I've tried Kalita trapezoid filters, but don't remember if they were as good as Sibarist filters because my chief complaint there is that the ones I got were a little too small for doing a full brew with 450 grams of water. Sibarist filters are unsustainably expensive, so it would be nice to compromise on price with other filters that are better than Melitta filters. I've looked at Cafec filters, but haven't been able to find the right size that are currently being sold domestically in the US. I'm a little mad at myself for trying Sibarist filters at this point.",

      "E37s burr replacement fallout: Hi all, I recently replaced the burrs on my Caedo e37s - the on-board display indicated that it hadn't had enough throughout to justify replacement, but the burrs were feeling a little blunt and there were some chips. After replacement, I had to completely readjust the grind to get espresso. I mean I had to detach and reattach the adjustment handle 3 times, as I couldn't go fine enough with the range it was set to pre-replacement. I blew through 500g of coffee making small adjustments before I eventually emptied the chamber and just dialled backwards from the burrs chirping. Two questions: 1. Is it normal for the grind to be so far out after burr replacement? It felt like I could have made a cafetiere coffee with what came out immediately after replacement 2. Should I be worried about burr alignment now, or is the e37s design fairly robust in eliminating misalignment? Thanks in advance and looking forward to exploring the sub \ud83d\ude4f"

      "For background: I'm completely new to brewing coffee (I used to just get from Dunkin' each day, but its significantly cheaper to make my own). As of right now, I have [a very basic drip coffee machine](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FVDYKKY), makes a single serving, I've been making ~10oz of water w/ 3-4 tbsp of Great Value Medium Roast coffee. I have absolutely no clue how much caffeine is in each cup, but it doesn't feel like its giving me much energy, and it doesn't taste great. I increased the amount of water to the max (14oz) and the number of tbsp of ground coffee to 4 to try and get more caffeine, but it still just doesn't feel like its working to give me much energy. Any tips, for anything really, flavor, how to find amount of caffeine, increase efficiency of the machine, etc? Edit: forgot to specify, but I do prefer hot coffee.

That's perfectly fine for me and my wife. When out on daytrips I'm used to packing a handpresso but the pads it uses are increasingly difficult to get plus it needs hot water which means lugging around a thermos and the water in there isn't really hot any more at the end of the day. Still when you feed it properly hot water it does produce a nice thimble full of the black stuff.. In the office the coffee from the machine is utterly vile. To the point I've started to carry sticks of instant, it is that bad. I'd stash a filter and some coffee but I have no place to put it, it's all hot desk open plan.

      "My experience won\u2019t be 100% transferable because my machine is in a very busy home environment but still sharing as I think my research is relevant for you. When I renovated my house I wanted to install a commercial machine as we go through way more volume than a normal home (longer story for another day but I often get asked by my roaster if I\u2019m running a small cafe\u2026). I ended up shopping synesso hydra, LM strada, and slayer against each other. I live in the Seattle area so am close to all three HQs (US vs global HQ for LM) and have good techs nearby for all three machines. I have a number of friends who are coffee professionals and got to speak to shops that run all three machines. Slayer stood out for lack of reliability and I crossed them off early. I have since heard that their reliability has improved and more shops are running them again. Between LM and Synesso reliability seems similar and the techs/shop owners I spoke to say service calls and parts availability are equal between the machines so that is a largely a wash. If counter space is a premium the Strada is a couple inches deeper than a Hydra- that was a real issue for me even in a larger home kitchen. From a Barista standpoint the Synesso seems to win. Shot pulling is similar but many folks told me their steaming wands are the best. One other thing that stood out- not that you\u2019d have to be talking to corporate very often but the Synesso team is awesome. I\u2019ve reached out a few times with questions and during the buying process and they were super cool about talking with me and psyched that someone was excited about their machines. Same for the Slayer team when I was researching. The LM team really didn\u2019t want to be bothered. Even though I can literally walk to their showroom they gave me the stiff arm and said go talk to a reseller, so that was a very different experience. My volume is nothing like a shop but my machine has done great now about 3 years in. I do outsource annual maintenance which is about $200 for an hour of labor plus consumables, again that would happen more frequently in commercial service.",
      "Having a good water filtration system that can be measured and is well monitored is the best preventative maintenance for any brand machine. After that, actual direct routine preventative maintenance will keep things running well. Definitely make sure to sign up for regular maintenance. Buy from a local technician company if you have the option. Emergency repairs and rush work do not spark joy for anyone. A tech company will be interested in preventing stressful situations for themselves and your shop by keeping you on a regular PM schedule. They might steer you towards the brand they like working on and have the parts for but they probably won't shy away from new stuff. Do the boring pragmatic water and preventative maintenance stuff so that you can make the passionate choice to get an awesome espresso machine that you actually want. Get the machine that is the most fun to look at, operate, talk about, and that makes the best bean juice! You probably know the answer you want already and you narrowed it down to two brands. But don't overlook that third brand that keeps sneaking its way into this conversation. You can totally get that other brand if you take maintenance seriously.",
      "Agree with most of everything that's been posted so far but I will say I despise the LM grouphead design with the gicleurs and excessive number of small copper tubes and fittings. The Synesso design seems a lot more elegant is a lot easier to service in that particular area.",
      "every issue you've had on a LM is going to be present on a Synesso. They are built with staggeringly similar internal builds (which makes sense when you realize that Synesso was founded by former LM employees) The one that will last longer and have fewer problems is the one that you or a local tech feels comfortable doing preventative maintenance on. If the local tech company carries Synesso steam wand rebuild kits but needs to special order La Marzocco ones, you should buy a Synesso. If vice versa you should buy a La Marzocco."

      "hey coffee lovers, I have a question about coffee apps. I know that's been long discussion brought up time to time but I wanted to talk about that further I can't comprehend how there's still no Vivino for coffee? I do completely understand that variety of coffee beans, roasting and brewing methods makes it pretty hard to keep track and have meaningful reviews however I still see many people asking coffee recommendations and also asking questions like \"how's Lavazza Oro compared to Lavazza rossa. I still see many people are interested in coffee reviewers, regardless it's not meaningful for coffee geeks/nerds. here's the thing, most of the coffee drinkers are just casual drinkers that probably can't tell the difference between different batches of same coffee. while there are great blends that are pretty consistent, I don't think people are looking for notes in coffee that shows up when you brew as espresso, but doesn't when you brew with v60, let's say. they simply wonder well-known coffee blends, sometimes even local blends to have review and see what people think I was wondering what's your final thought on this?",
      "I recently purchased 5 lbs of Ethiopia Anaerobic Worka Sakaro whole beans from Rooster Roaster and plan to split them evenly with a friend, 2.5 lbs each. I\u2019ve read that anaerobic processed beans often benefit from a rest period of about 2-3 weeks after roasting to fully develop their flavors. Based on that, here\u2019s my tentative preservation plan, and I\u2019d really appreciate your thoughts or suggestions: 1. Open the 5 lb bag and split it evenly\u20142.5 lbs each. 2. Transfer my 2.5 lbs into an airtight (but not vacuum-sealed) container, and let it rest for 2 weeks at room temperature in a cool, dark place. 3. After resting, divide the beans into 20g portions (around 57 batches), and vacuum-seal each batch in individual sealer bags. 4. Freeze about 40 batches. Keep the remaining 17 batches at room temperature to consume first. 5. Use one batch per day for the first 17 days. 6. Once I begin thawing the frozen batches, I\u2019ll thaw them one at a time, only as needed. If I notice that the flavor continues to improve day by day (i.e., with longer post-roast rest), I may start pulling some batches out of the freezer earlier and let them rest a few extra days at room temperature before using. This is the plan I\u2019ve formed based on research and recommendations I\u2019ve read about freezing coffee beans. Would this approach work well for preserving flavor and freshness? Any suggestions for improving it would be greatly appreciated.",

And, if I'm being honest, I too would like to wake up and grind fresh beans without having to work for it sometimes. That being said, what's similar or better than the Lido 3 in perhaps a $200-400 price range? I'm mainly making pourovers, with occasional espresso-based beverages coming from a Nanopresso, so grinders made primarily for espresso aren't really a necessity unless they're just worth picking up at that price. I don't know how my Lido 3 compares to the current meta of the grinder world, but I know I get incredibly tasty coffee with it every time.

Even Cheerios are fine - whole grain, low sugar and some fiber. Granola is almost always a sugar vehicle with little nutritional value, and I avoid Frankensoy products except on occasion.

      "I intentionally acquired the taste for sardines\u2014I didn\u2019t like them initially. My first tip is to (at least initially) buy sardine cans in the $1.50-$2.50 range from an international grocery store instead of the cheapest available (beach cliff, chicken of the sea, great value, etc) at your regular grocery. The bottom tier of sardines are way lower quality than the cheap imports, so paying even 50 cents more can make a huge difference in your enjoyment. Once you\u2019ve acquired the taste, you might want to switch to the cheap stuff, but until then, the low end imports are your best option. Have you tried sardines in oil or a flavorful sauce instead of water? I can\u2019t do sardines in water, but I love the $1.99 cans of Sultan sardines in olive oil with chili peppers. Also worth noting that the sardines in tomato sauce/other sauces are meant to be heated before serving, whereas the sardines in oil are good cold from the can. Asian a rule, Asian sardines are also intended to be heated, and are best when added to a rice cooker 5-10 minutes before the rice is done. Another big tip is that the skinless/boneless sardines actually taste fishier! I recommend going for the big hunk sardines (brisling) over the little ones (sprats). You can easily peel the skin off/debone the big ones yourself if the skin/bones give you the ick. I also recommend adding them to other stuff. They\u2019re great in chunks in pasta with red sauce, or on sandwiches with tomato slices, labneh cheese, and scallions. If you keep with it and keep trying different kinds, you\u2019ll be a regular sardine lover soon enough.",
      "This is probably going to be unpopular....but I like them with lots of mustard and some good quality ketchup. Or BBQ sauce, like Sweet Baby Ray's. I don't like the taste of them, but they're a great source of protein and vitamin D. So strong sauce is good on them lol.",
      "It's worth recognizing that not all sardines are the same fish! Just learning this myself, and it makes a lot of sense of why I like some brands more than others. They're different species. There are a bunch of small fish that get called sardines, but the big common split people seem to talk about is brisling vs. pilchard. I definitely seem to prefer the pilchards. So maybe figure out what you're currently eating and see if you like the other better. You can also have options like skinless and boneless. Less cheap, but I found a foil-pouch brand of smoked trout on Amazon that is excellent.",
      "I love sardines (matiz is my fave) but I find that not all brands are to my liking (price point does matter in this case) I mash with a squeeze of lemon and some capers and put on avocado toast with some fresh herbs and tomato But sometimes you just don\u2019t like a food\u2026and that is also ok",
      "Do you like canned tuna? I usually mix Greek yogurt, pickles, celery, any seasonings, Dijon mustard, ect into mine and make a sardine salad and put on anything. It\u2019s a mindset. I think if you never grow up with this fish you would be hesitant to eat it. But it\u2019s incredibly good for you.

Lots of veggies go well with sweet things. Zucchini bread, pumpkin pudding, carrot cake...

One example: carrots are where the plant stores the sugar it makes through photosynthesis. If you\u2019re up for a longer-term project, reduce the overly sweet stuff in your diet gradually, and see what starts to taste sweet now.

This is an example, https://youtu.be/lxMO9tDL1aM?si=Pyirw5BjJZEENRxO (Broccoli is rich in: Vitamin C (immunity, skin) Vitamin K (bone health, blood clotting) Folate (cell repair, especially important during pregnancy) Fiber (digestion, heart health) Potassium (blood pressure regulation)) Another simple alternative https://youtu.be/Jla8iay99_U?si=6KxoScB9EIQ7JLHh High in Nutrients Rich in vitamins A, C, and K Contains folate, manganese, and fiber Low in calories (about 30\u201335 calories per cup cooked)) I would focus more on cherry tomatoes,eggplant, carrots, sweet potatoes,zukkini and after you get tired of those you can might crave the peppers. I hope it was helpful.\ud83d\ude0a",
      "I know you say it's the taste, but is texture also an issue? For example, I really dislike jarred red peppers, am okay with sauteed peppers and freaking love them if charred or grilled (or done like in fajitas, whatever that magic is). Somehow, making them less watery is magic. Some people also really hate the skins, which can be charred off on the grill or over a gas stove pretty easily. If it's really just the taste that incurs rage, bell/sweet peppers are mainly a good source of vitamin C, which is easy to get from citrus (and easy to absorb from vitamins if you don't like fruit). They're not particularly great sources of fiber or protein - they're mainly in recipes because people like them and they bulk up meals without adding a ton of calories. Zucchini, eggplant, mushrooms, and tomatoes would act pretty similarly as far as cooking times and calories (mushroom might need more liquid added, tomatoes a bit less). If the peppers are a minor component, leaving them out is also fine. If you want a hint of sweetness without the bell pepper flavor, tomato paste is a good substitute.",
      "After going through your comments I believe you're trying to make chili without jalapenos or bell peppers. Onion, garlic, tomatoes, and even corn are pretty present. I love making slow cooker chili and here's what I recommend: Pick your onion of choice. Quarter ring slice: add early as a texture replacement for peppers. Diced, large: add before final simmer. (maybe an hour, tops). Diced, small: upon serving (raw, crunchy!) Garlic, fresh ground or diced add halfway through. Tomatoes can be added later as well. Corn is totally forgiving, add early for softer, later for firmer texture. Celery, carrots, sweet potatoes are good too. My mother couldn't handle ANY spice, so I had to tailor chili for her. She also hated bell peppers, so I sauteed and kept on the side to add to my own bowl. I do tons of stuff in the slow cooker. Today I put in a whole chicken with little more than a few herbs and chicken broth and leftover frozen veggies. Last week I did taco meat, and ribs before that. On average I use the slow cooker twice a week.",
      "I, too, abhor bell peppers. I have found the small sweet peppers edible, they don\u2019t look like bell peppers and don\u2019t have that offensive green flavor in them, try those before you cook with them though! They usually are red, orange and yellow. Do you have the same issue with yellow bell peppers? They\u2019re the least offensive of the bell peppers for me. For other options, you can use a vegetable peeler on carrots, parsnips, zucchini, cabbage, or use some sun-dried tomatoes (not packed in oil) depending on the recipe you\u2019re subbing for. Often peppers are with onions and garlic so I\u2019ll usually add extra onion in those recipes in lieu of the peppers addition. Might have good luck with poblanos instead of jalape\u00f1os, I\u2019ve found they work for me. Green Chiles in a can are also a nice lightly spicy sub if you don\u2019t like jalape\u00f1os, I\u2019ll use the canned green chilis in Mexican sauces instead of jalape\u00f1os. Totally if they\u2019re for texture I\u2019ll lean towards cabbage or carrot ribbons as a pepper sub. If they\u2019re for flavor, I\u2019ll try a roasted poblano or the small sweet peppers or just the extra onion. Good on you for branching out and trying new things!",
      "Don't forget about zucchinis, squash, or eggplant. Great thing about all of these is that they have a very mild flavor and they tend to absorb the flavors that are cooked around them specially eggplant. One of the greatest things I've told friends when their experimenting to try to get into new vegetables and fruit is to eat with the season. So whatever season you're currently experiencing and you're part of the world see what's currently in season buy those things and try those things and the next season that happens try what's in season. This gives you multiple seasons multiple things to try during each season to find out what you like what tastes good with what you're cooking."

Shred some cheddar into barely warm rice and mix it up. It's good if the cheese doesn't quite melt. 7. Meatloaf burgers. There's a million different recipes for meatloaf, and if you squish them into burger patties, most will work. Add some additional binder and protein by blending toasted rolled oats and beans. 8. Veggie burger. Black (or other) beans, oat meal or cooked rice, cooked sweet potato, this mix supports adding other minced veg as available. Season with pepper and salt on the outside to add to the char. Tip: Mince celery, onion, bell pepper and keep it for adding to just about anything. Add finely shredded carrot instead of bell pepper if you're not growing peppers. This mix will freeze well for future meatloaf or burgers. Also known as \"trinity\" and \"mirepoix(?)\"",

      "Absolute struggle meal moments in my life: When my parents abandoned me and I was homeless as a teen, I stayed in school and kept it a secret (I thought I would be in trouble and that they'd take me away from my high school friends and band--which was what kept me hanging in there). I also thought school was the only way out. I would eat leftovers from friends at the lunch table. The last bite of their sandwich or banana. Whatever any of them wanted to give me. A couple of friends realized I was struggling and would often save me something or give me their chips, etc. I also discovered the band director's office had a dish of hard candies you could take--so I'd grab a couple of those. I just couldn't bring myself to eat out of the trash, but I remember grabbing food from plates at this outdoor restaurant patio that people had not finished. They looked like clean people, and they'd left a bunch of untouched dinner rolls and one whole taco. lol. Also during this window of homelessness, I'd get food from a church that was often unusable (canned goods with no can opener, flour with no way for me to cook or prep it, etc.). But when I got jars of peanut butter or cheap jelly, I could keep them in my bag and eat spoonfuls here and there. I would also sometimes be able to get a few dollars and get fries from McDonalds, or one of those mini green or red burritos from Taco Bell (this is back in the early 90s) and I'd grab extra sauce or ketchup packets to eat later. Later, as an adult (still impacted by poverty and a lack of familial resources), there have been times when I had to eat a cold struggle meal with no electricity, etc. But my most common adult struggle meals (with access to a stove or microwave) have been cheap ramen + a bag of frozen veggies, rice + furikake seasoning, canned beans, a tub of tofu (stretched over several days). I do like beans, furikake and tofu, so it beats the hell out of eating Taco Bell mild sauce or the tail end of someone's ham sandwich).",

      "To add onto the bit about produce, don't forget local orchards and such. There's an apple orchard not far from where my parents live and so every October when I go down to visit them, I'll stop by and buy several massive bags of apples for a great price. Check to see what they are picking right now, but know that they'll usually run out of apples by mid-November and won't have any more until June. Plus if you go right at the end of the season for each variety of apple, you can get culls for even cheaper (I'm talking a 10-12 pound bag for like 3 bucks), and they're still great for eating and cooking. And if you have a peach orchard near you, I am in envy, because fresh peaches are utterly amazing. And don't forget that many orchards also sell other things like sweet potatoes, honey, etc for good prices. My favorite apple varieties from my local apple orchard are Arkansas Black and Winesap, but they also have Golden Delicious, Red Delicious, Granny Smith, Fujis, and a few others I can't think of right now.",
      "One thing I want to add to this, batch cooking is the way forward as long as you have freezer space and Tupperware. This way you can buy bagged veg (usually cheaper in the UK compared to loose), make a week's worth of meals and freeze them down into daily portions. This allows better cost management of your weeks meals, reduces the trips to the supermarket reducing the liklihood of buying hungry or on impulse and better knowledge in the nutrition you are getting with each meal. Writing a shopping list is a huge factor as well as this keeps you focused on what you need to buy, limits the time spent wandering where you are more likely to buy processed foods or snacks. Find 2/3 recipes that you enjoy with similar bases, a starch of your choice and you can rotate your meals daily freeing up money, time and less washing up every day. Lastly, eggs are your best friend! Cheap, versatile and full of protein. You can never have too many eggs in your house and can be used as snacks when boiled, top ups for lunch and dinner as well as prepped for sandwiches. Source - ex-chef of 8 years who eats like I'm poor",
      ">\\-KEEP IN MIND that rice is pure carbs. It\u2019s a good base, but you need other stuff to go with it or else you\u2019ll be deficient in nutrients and feel awful all the time. Trust me from experience - college me went through a raw-egg-on-rice phase, and it wasn\u2019t pretty. This isn't actually true though. Rice is far from 'pure carbs'. If you were to eat 2000 calories of brown rice, you'd actually meet your recommended daily intake of all essential amino acids, with the exception of lysine (which you'd get 70% of). You'd get over 40 grams of protein, 15 grams of fat as well as about 30 grams of dietary fibre. You would also also meet your recommended daily intake for B1, B3, B5 and B9 vitamins. In addition to that you'd also meet your recommended daily intake for iron and selenium (edit: and manganese). Sure, if you pick white rice you're not getting as many dietary fibres, but you're still getting the other stuff. It won't give you EVERYTING you need - but rice is far from pure carbs. >Keep a stock of beans, lentils, and dried chickpeas around if you can. They\u2019re cheap, almost always available, and virtually imperishable. > >Wait for those huge sacks of rice to go on sale (it happens pretty frequently), then buy 2. They last forever. I'm having a hard time understanding why a professional chef would make this point. Sure, you can keep dry legumes for five years, rice too - but they most definitely don't cook nor taste the same after years of storage. It doesn't make any sense to buy two huge bags of rice unless you actually go through a bag in a matter of weeks or you're prepping for a disaster. I think you should keep a stock of all these things, but there is no point in building a stock that will last years. I've had to discard plenty of old beans because they just won't cook properly, and I've had lentils that turned dark-ish brown/black after years of storage. >\u2014\u2014-PROTEINS\u2014\u2014- I think you could very well add a disclaimer here that says you don't need to buy 'proteins'. It's literally\\* impossible to be deficient in protein while eating enough calories, and correct me if I'm wrong, but what you refer to as 'proteins' are some of the most expensive things to buy. \\*If you live primarily off of oil, sugar or other heavily processed foods, this isn't true - but it is true if sticking to wholefoods, which your post does seem to have an emphasis on. Edit: My source for the amino acids was [https://tools.myfooddata.com/protein-calculator/168875/200cals/1](https://tools.myfooddata.com/protein-calculator/168875/200cals/1) \\- but other sources have slightly different numbers - another source I found indicates RDI is met for all essential amino acids with 2000 calories, and another that you'd be a bit short on methionine or cystine instead, but my point is that living off of rice alone would pretty much satisfy your essential amino acid needs, even though they aren't considered 'complete proteins'.",
      "I'd add - mix your grains! Koreans know the shiz, man - mixed grain rice is a (very expensive sometimes) thing. You can buy a ready made mix to add to rice in Asian markets, but honestly? Use what you already have in the house. Soak some lentils, barley, whole oats if you have them - the idea is to get things that will cook together in the same amount of time. So Barley needs more time than rice - soak that before you cook and the time evens out. Start out using like 1/3 mixed grain and 2/3 rice. It's SUPER yummy, and you get a lot more filling/nutrient power in the same serving size. Whole grains are gonna fill you up, and mixed legumes and grains will give you more protein and nutrients.",

      "I'm thrilled that she's getting onto cooking. This was actually her request (she'd had them at a restaurant and wanted to make them herself). We made some with shrimp and some without. It's really versatile, you could fill them with whatever protein and vegetables you like. [In the article](https://nerdswithknives.com/vietnamese-summer-rolls-peanut-sauce/) I go into tips for rolling and other stuff if you're interested. ### Ingredients (this makes 16 rolls) #### For the peanut sauce: * 3/4 cup 190g creamy peanut butter * 1/3 cup 80ml hot water * 1/4 cup 60ml hoisin sauce * 2 tablespoons 30ml rice vinegar * 1 tablespoon 15ml soy sauce * 1 tablespoon 15ml fish sauce * A medium garlic clove grated * 2 teaspoons 10ml toasted sesame oil * 2 teaspoons 8g sugar * 1 teaspoon 12g chili-garlic paste #### For the summer rolls: * 4 ounces 115g dried rice vermicelli noodles * 24 medium shrimp about 1 pound, 450g, peeled and deveined * 16 8-1/2-inch round rice paper wrappers * 1 bunch mint leaves * 16 butter or green leaf lettuce leaves * 1 cup finely shredded red cabbage about 3 oz./ 85g * 1 cup finely shredded carrots about 3 oz./ 85g * 4 Persian or 1/2 of one small English cucumber, cut into matchsticks * 3 medium scallions cut into slivers about 3 inches long * 1 small bunch fresh cilantro sprigs ### Instructions 1. For the peanut sauce: Whisk all the ingredients together in a small bowl; set aside. 2. For the summer rolls: Cook the rice noodles according to the package directions. Drain and set aside. 3. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the shrimp, turn off heat and poach until bright pink and opaque, about 1 1/2 minutes. Drain in a colander and run under very cold water until cool. Dry with paper towels and cut each shrimp in half horizontally (making them thinner). Place on a plate, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until you\u2019re ready to roll. 4. Fill a wide, shallow dish large enough to hold the rice paper wrappers with warm water. Arrange all of the filling ingredients within easy reach around a work surface. Lay down a lettuce leaf and place a arrange a little bit of rice noodles, cabbage, carrots, cucumbers, scallions and a few cilantro leaves in the middle. Roll lettuce around the noodles and vegetables in a cigar shape and set aside, seam side down. 5. Working with 1 wrapper at a time, submerge rice paper until it is soft and pliable, about 10 seconds (it will soften more as it sits). Remove the wrapper from the water and place it on the work surface. Lay 3 shrimp halves in a row, cut side facing up, just above the center of the wrapper, leaving about 1 inch of space on each side. Place 1 mint leaf between each shrimp. Place the filled lettuce roll just below the shrimp. 6. Fold the bottom half of the rice paper wrapper over the filling and roll until the shrimp and lettuce are secured. Then fold in the sides of the wrapper. Then roll the entire wrapper so it becomes sealed, like a burrito. Place roll on a rimmed baking sheet and cover loosely with a lightly damp paper towel and plastic wrap. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and fillings. Leave a little space between each summer roll so they don\u2019t stick together. If not serving immediately, keep the rolls covered with damp towels and plastic wrap at room temperature for up to 2 hours. Serve with the peanut sauce for dipping.",

      "I like casseroles. A cheap one is baked spaghetti. I'm a fan of mushrooms for a cheap, healthy and lean, protein. You can treat them like flavor sponges, marinate them for at least an hour in a vinaigrette dressing, soy sauce, or whatever, saute them, or add straight to a casserole. They are \"expensive\" for produce, but cheaper than meat, but just as much protein, without the gas associated with a legume. Potatoes, rice, pasta are good \"carb\" bases but rice has more protein. Rice is used in China as a staple, meats are used as condiments for rice, unlike the American bastardization of the cuisine. This is far beyond the ask and more work, but an excellent source of high protein: get a pet hen, rather than a pet parakeet. She won't crow, so city & neighborhood friendly, she can lay an egg almost every day, if she is young and has enough light. She will eat kitchen scraps, and produce manure that is highly valuable to a gardener/composter. The eggs you raise yourself are WAY more nutrient-dense than what you can buy in the store. But, admittedly, that is often more commitment than most young folks want. Just saying it's a system that garners many benefits. Here is a link: https://cs-tf.com/indoor-chickens/ Bottom line, most home-cooked meals cost around 4 2021 dollars. That number might be closer to $4.4-5 now with this year's inflation. You can make cheaper meals, but flavorful meals are by far more satisfying to cook. Extending the good stuff with rice is great, but consider adding a Greek yogurt sauce for another cozy protein that also feels hearty and rich. If you have an oven, baked potatoes are good to cook many meals at once, but will only last a few days in the fridge. Soups and stews are cheap and can be frozen in serving sized freezer bags.

      "**Watermelon Whole Fruit Popsicles** You can replace the watermelon puree with honeydew melon or cantaloupe puree. Use any fresh organic fruit you have on hand. I like using contrasting colors because it makes the popsicles look so pretty! And don't forget to use seedless watermelon. **Ingredients** * 3 cups watermelon puree (about 1/4 to 1/2 a watermelon) * 1/2 cup fresh blueberries * 1/2 cup chopped fresh strawberries * 1 kiwi, peeled and sliced * 1 peach or nectarine, diced small handful fresh cherries, pitted and chopped **Directions** Cut the watermelon into chunks and then puree it in a blender until smooth. Set aside. Set out about 1 dozen popsicle molds (amount needed will vary depending on size of molds). Fill each one with the chopped fresh fruit. Then pour in the watermelon puree until each mold is full to the top. Place a popsicle stick into each one. Place into your freezer and freeze for about 6 to 8 hours. When ready to serve, run the popsicle molds under warm water for a few seconds and then pull each one out. Enjoy! Source: www.NourishingMeals.com",
      "So fun to see! I made watermelon strawberry sorbet today! Its sitting in the freezer now, but I could've had a serving when it was freshly made because the fruit was pre-frozen. I really considered making some of it into popsicles for my toddler. Those are a lot easier for her and way more fun. As a matter of fact, I'm gonna get up and check. If the sorbet hasn't frozen totally solid, I'm gonna make some popsicles. For anyone interested, the recipe: Half a watermelon (or about 5 to 6 cups), frozen in chunks 1 cup strawberry quarters, frozen 1 cup (give or take a couple TBSP) cold water 1/4 cup lemon juice Toss half of all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth. It may require a few rounds or a little extra water. Pour into big Tupperware. Repeat with second half of ingredients, then mix it all together in the bowl. (I had to do it in 2 batches because my blender isn't big enough for half a watermelon.) Then serve, freeze to scoop later, or pour into popsicle molds. You could also add extra sugar or use more strawberries, but I wanted it to have a very \"watermelon\" flavor.",

Rice + chicken breast + apple & onion saut\u00e9ed together = sweet chicken rice. Rice + diced chicken breast + saut\u00e9ed onion + soy sauce = low calorie fried rice.

Grandma uses celery but I\u2019m not a fan so I season with celery salt instead. I always go light on the mayo. Quiche was my struggle dish last night. It might sound complicated but if you have a pie crust it\u2019s super easy to make and easy to change out filling options.

      "**Recipe** I am in quarantine so I used ingredients that I had on hand. Pot pies are extremely versatile so pretty much any of these ingredients could be swapped out. Make it however you like! **Ingredients (Pot Pie Filling)** (Amounts are estimates because I did not measure and made it up as I went. This filling recipe yields approx 4 mini pot pies and enough leftover filling for probably 4 more.) * Turkey Breast (I cooked a whole turkey breast and used 1/2 of it for this recipe) * Onion (1 whole) * Garlic (Approx 2 cloves or a few teaspoons) * Carrots (1-1 1/2 cups diced * Celery (4-6 stalks) * Green beans (1 Cup diced) * Diced Potatoes (1 1/2 diced...totally optional I just had some that were about to go bad and I actually love potatoes in my pot pies..I think it makes them extra filling) * Turkey Stock (Turkey bones & Veggie Scraps -Simmered in a dutch oven on stovetop for 5 hours) * Salt, Pepper, Thyme, Sage (Taste as you go...I personally love extra black pepper in mine) * Cornstarch for Thickening (Cornstarch Slurry -Water mixed with cornstarch) **(Pie Crust)** * Unsalted Butter (2 Sticks) * Flour 2 1/4 Cups (I used All Purpose) * Salt (1 Teaspoon) * Ice Water (8-10 Tablespoons) **Directions** **Pie Crust**\\- Cut 2 cold sticks of butter into small pieces and place them into the freezer for a few minutes (It's important that the butter and water remain very cold- Remember to not over work your dough so it doesn't get warm) Mix together flour and salt in a bowl. Add butter to bowl and \"cut\" the butter into the flour (You can use a pastry cutter, 2 forks, or a food processor) It should bunch together a bit and make pea sized clumps. Add ice water one tablespoon at a time and mix together with a spatula. Mold dough into a thick disk shape and wrap it in plastic wrap and place into fridge for at least 1 hour (up to four days). When you are ready to roll out your pie crust: Pull dough out of fridge. Let dough warm up a little (this will make it more pliable). On a lightly floured surface rolling your dough out into desired size. I did bake my bottom crust for about 10-15 mins before adding filling to ensure it wouldn't be completely soggy. Finally add your filling and top crust and bake at 350-375 for 30-40 mins or until golden brown on top. (You can add butter or egg wash on top of crust before baking for better color and flavor) **Filling-** I started by sauteing my onion, celery, carrots, and garlic in the bottom of my dutch oven with a little butter for about 5 mins. Add the remainder of ingredients to pot (except potatoes and cornstarch). You can cook as long as you like but I let my base simmer for a few hours in a dutch oven on the stove top. Add potatoes (I waited to add potatoes to the did not turn to mush) Finally, Make a cornstarch slurry (Mix water and cornstarch and then add it to your pot) Let that cook for a few more minutes until you have your desired thickness. &#x200B; Please note that I am not saying this recipe is the best way to make a pot pie.

      "If you've had bao buns before these are the same base recipe but have scallions rolled into them along with some salt and sichuan peppercorn. The ones you'll find in restaurants/pre-made are made with super well refined very very white and low gluten flour which gives them that almost cake like texture but this recipe is a little more homestyle :) Hope the recipe is clear and the notes about ingredients at the end helpful! [I also made a video recipe here if anyone was interested! - the twisting and shaping is a little difficult to explain in words so seeing it visually is a bit easier](https://youtu.be/05Zrb-4UllI) **Ingredients** \u30fb375g Flour \u30fb7g Yeast \u30fb10g Oil \u30fb15g Caster sugar \u30fb190g Milk (or water) \u30fbFor the filling: neutral oil, green onions, salt, (optional: Sichuan peppercorn powder or 5 spice) **Instructions:** 1. Mix the flour, yeast and oil together in a large bowl. 2. Dissolve the sugar in the milk and pour into the flour mixture. 3. Combine to form a rough ball with no dry flour left. Cover with a damp towel and leave to rest for 15 minutes. 4. Finely chop the green onions (optional: mix with a pinch of baking powder to help them stay green during steaming). 5. Knead the dough until the surface becomes smooth. Split into 2 and set one half aside covered with a damp towel. Knead the other until a shiny smooth ball forms. Switch, and repeat. 6. Take the first ball and roll out into a 32x25cm rectangle. 7. Use your hands or a brush to brush a very thin coating of oil onto the entire surface. Distribute chopped green onions evenly, sprinkle salt and (optional) Sichuan peppercorn powder. 8. We're going to fold the 32 cm side into thirds. Fold one edge onto itself and then take the other edge and fold it onto the layer you just created. Like closing a brochure. 9. Cut into 8 equal pieces. Cut each of the 8 pieces into 6 thin slices. 10. Each bun uses 8 of these slices. Arrange the 8 slices in 2 layers: 4 on the bottom and 4 on top. Place them so that the 3 folded layers are facing the table and also facing you. 11. Pinch the ends closed and gently stretch to to 1.5x the length. If you're right handed, twist clockwise and the dough will naturally curve inwards towards you into a circular shape and you should be able to align the 2 ends together. Pinch along where they meet and place downwards. Shape and pinch together any unattached areas. Repeat for all 6 buns. Leave to rest uncovered ([if the shaping is hard to envision then hopefully this video here will help](https://youtu.be/05Zrb-4UllI) \\- around the 6 minute timestamp I think is where I do the shaping) 12. Repeat with the other half of the dough. 13. Leave all 12 buns to proof uncovered until they've risen 1.5-2x in size (around 30 minutes). Prepare your steamer about 5 minutes before steaming so everything is preheated and the water is boiling. 14. Steam on medium heat for 20 minutes. Close the heat and leave in the steamer for another 3 minutes. Enjoy! I like to eat it with fermented tofu but eat however you want :) \\*Notes on the ingredients: \\- Flour: if you want pale and super fluffy buns then you'll want to use a low gluten content flour. If you have access to Hong Kong flour (should be able to be found in asian grocery stores) then it's best. Cake flour also works well. All purpose/plain flour is absolutely fine to but if you want them fluffier then sub 2 tbsp of flour from the 375g with 2 tbsp of corn flour. I used 200g Hong Kong flour and 175g plain flour. \\- Baking powder: Some recipes use baking powder. This makes the texture more cake like and so I think it's great for sweet steamed buns but generally I don't add it for savoury ones. To me it's more 'home style' like this and has really nice slight chew which is how the ones made for me by family have always been. But it's completely up to you is you add a tsp or not. \\- Oil: Use a neutral oil, if you have duck fat/goose fat/lard that's also ok. \\- Milk: whole milk will make the fluffiest and best tasting buns that stay soft/re-steam the best. I generally just use whatever I have at home though. Water is fine and plant based milks works well to! \\- Filling: I didn't give measurements for the filling as usually for Chinese cooking its very much 'to taste' or however much you feel is good. But for a rough guide I would say about 1/3 cup green onions, 10g salt and 4g peppercorn powder :)",
      "These are best homemade, commercial ones skimp on the flavouring oil and scallions which are super important because otherwise they just taste like a regular mantou. When they are nice homemade ones though.... Wow, they are amazing. My mum used to make these on Sundays as a treat.",
      "I have had these , or something like it. When I was younger, I dated a girl from Taiwan but her mother was from mainland China. Super delicious. Now every time I\u2019m in a china town or district I look for these. I also like \u201cstreet buns\u201d . Now I can finally try my hand at making them.",
      "These look amazing. \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70",
      "These are rising as I type this. I don\u2019t have a legit steamer so I hope they turn out okay in my veggie steamer basket. I\u2019m so excited to taste them! Edit to add: they were amazing. My tummy is so happy."

      "I worked with an amazing food writer to put together a resource for different salad dressings. These are just base guidelines and not super defined recipes but hopefully it gives you a good place to start for inspiration! Making your own dressing is super rewarding and easy to nail down once you get the ratios/emulsification part right and really helps to elevate your salad. My personal favorite is vinaigrette with just oil, lemon juice, and mustard whisked together with a bit of salt and pepper. I actually made the thousand island dressing as it was listed below but with Greek yogurt instead of mayo and it was AWESOME! You can read the [full article here](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/2018/07/20/homemade-salad-dressings-make-a-star-out-of-salad/), if you're interested. #Vinaigrettes The simplest salad dressing\u2014and an easy recipe to riff on with your own favorite flavors\u2014is the classic vinaigrette, using oil, vinegar, and mustard. The standard ratio is three parts oil to one part vinegar, and the most basic version uses olive oil, white wine vinegar, and a dollop of mustard, plus salt and pepper. But there\u2019s no reason to hold off there: switching the vinegar for a balsamic or Champagne upgrades it instantly, while using a citrus juice like lemon, lime, or grapefruit brings a fun zing. You can get creative with other oils, like avocado, pumpkin seed, or hazelnut. And the mustard can be switched out for a little honey if that matches the other flavors better. -- **Standard Vinaigrette:** All you really need is oil, vinegar, and a bit of emulsifier\u2014usually mustard\u2014to pull this standard together. *Recipe:* 3:1 oil and vinegar ratio 1 teaspoon mustard (dijon or whole grain) Salt and pepper to taste -- **Italian Dressing:** This tabletop favorite is actually just a basic olive oil and red or white wine vinegar vinaigrette mixed with a few herbs\u2014fresh parsley and dried basil, oregano, and red pepper\u2014with lemon juice and garlic. *Recipe:* 3:1 oil and vinegar ratio 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley Dried basil, oregano, and crushed red pepper to taste 1 tablespoon lemon juice 2 fresh garlic cloves, minced Salt and pepper to taste -- **Balsamic Vinaigrette:** Balsamic vinegar makes a tart and sweet base for salads, so it\u2019s a common vinaigrette ingredient, usually with a splash of honey to bring it together. *Recipe:* 3:1 oil and balsamic vinegar ratio Salt and pepper to taste ----------------- #Caesar Salad Dressing Like a vinaigrette, Caesar salad dressing is an emulsion: the egg yolk works as the emulsifying agent and the lemon juice as the acid. The extra ingredients\u2014pepper, anchovies, and Parmesan\u2014just help to emulsify it. This is useful knowledge for anyone trying to make a riff on the dish: don\u2019t like using raw eggs? Just use some mayonnaise or even yogurt in place of the egg yolk. Feeling like tweaking it? Try it with lime, or go with yuzu juice. Just like the standard vinaigrette, once you master the ratio, playing with flavors becomes easier. -- **Caesar Dressing:** Perhaps one of the most iconic single dressings in American cuisine, this dressing gets its body from a raw egg yolk mixed with oil, and its flavor from a trio of big guns: anchovies, parmesan, and garlic. *Recipe:* 2 large egg yolks 2 minced garlic cloves 1 teaspoon anchovy paste 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1/2 cup olive oil 1/2 cup freshly grated Parm cheese Salt and pepper to taste (Whisk everything except olive oil and parm cheese...slowly incorporate oil until emulsified, whisk in cheese, season with salt/pepper) -- **Mayo-based Caesar Dressing:** For the squeamish, the immunity-compromised, or the lazy, the ready-made emulsion of mayonnaise makes it easy to simply stir in the flavor components of Caesar dressing and then it with a little extra lemon juice. *Recipe:* 1 cup mayo (or greek yogurt) 2 minced garlic cloves 1 teaspoon anchovy paste 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1/2 cup freshly grated Parm cheese Salt and pepper to taste --------------------------- #Creamy Dressings Creamy dressings\u2014like green goddess or ranch dressing\u2014tend to do well with heartier salads and chunkier vegetables, as they may weigh down fragile greens. While cream itself is an emulsion, the truth is most of the creamy salad dressings you\u2019re familiar with come from a mayonnaise base, which makes them even easier to make than a vinaigrette. And, in most cases, you can swap out the mayo for yogurt or Greek yogurt for a lighter or tangier version. For most of these, you can just toss all the ingredients into a blender and whiz together your favorite dressing. **All versions below can use greek yogurt instead of mayo, sour cream, or buttermilk** -- **Blue Cheese:** The funky flavor of blue cheese gets tangy with mayonnaise and sour cream or buttermilk in this big-flavor American classic that\u2019s simple to stir together. *Recipe:* 1 cup mayonnaise (or mixture of mayo/sour cream/buttermilk) 1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese 1/2 cup half and half 1 tablespoon lemon juice Salt and pepper to taste You can whisk all blue cheese with ingredients, or whisk half and then add half at the end for a chunkier option. -- **Green Goddess:** Practically synonymous with fresh flavors, this California specialty packs in a truckload of herbs, brought together with a little mayonnaise and sour cream (and sometimes avocado, in a modern version) *Recipe:* 1 teaspoon anchovy paste (optional) 1 garlic clove, minced. 3/4 cup mayonnaise (or greek yogurt) 3/4 cup sour cream (or greek yogurt) 1/2 cup chopped parsley 1/4 cup chopped tarragon 2 scallions, minced 3 Tbsp chopped chives 2 Tbsp lemon juice *You can also add spinach to get more greens!* -- **Ranch:** America\u2019s favorite buttermilk-herb dressing went from a niche restaurant product to mainstream quickly, and has now taken on an iconic spot on grocery shelves. Use herbs such as fresh (or dried) dill, parsley, and fresh green onions or fresh/dried chives. *Recipe:* 1 cup Mayonnaise (or Greek yogurt) \u00bd cup Sour Cream \u00bd cup Buttermilk 2 tablespoons fresh minced dill (or 2 tsps dry) 2 tablespoons fresh minced parsley (or 2 tsps dry) 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon onion powder Sugar, to taste Salt and pepper to taste ------------------ #Mayonnaise-based Dressings Mayonnaise on its own makes for an easy base (and, again, easily substituted for yogurt) and has become the base of at least two favorites: Russian and Thousand Island. Both begin with a mayo base and take much of their flavor from ketchup without any additional creaminess coming in later, Russian veers toward horseradish for sharpness and thousand island uses sweet pickle relish. -- **Russian Dressing:** From a base of mayonnaise and ketchup, the horseradish and hot sauce lift this into a creamy, sharp dressing. *Recipe:* 1 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup ketchup 1 tablespoon onion finely minced Salt and pepper to taste Hot sauce to taste Horseradish to taste -- **Thousand Island:** Like an overturned condiment cart, thousand island mixes mayonnaise, ketchup, and relish, with vinegar and garlic, for a unique and tangy dressing. *Recipe:* 1 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup ketchup 1 tablespoon onion finely minced 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar 2 teaspoons relish 1 teaspoon sugar Salt and pepper to taste --------------- #Alternative Dressings Who says your salad dressing needs to use any of these classic methods? Nobody! While the texture of emulsification tends to do well, there are other ways to get the same texture or others that work well for salads: tahini as a base, using chia seeds in a citrus-based liquid, and even just blending up large amounts herbs like mint and parsley with a light oil until they just come together. -- **Tahini Dressing:** The sesame seed paste known as tahini comes already thick and creamy, so turning it into a salad dressing simple requires thinning it out with a bit of lemon juice and olive oil and then adding flavors\u2014from basic chopped garlic to spicy pickled peppers. *Recipe* 1/2 cup tahini 1/2 cup water 1/4 cup lemon juice Salt, pepper, and cayenne powder to taste -- **Herb Dressing:** There\u2019s no rules on this one, just clean up whatever herbs are floating in your fridge or garden, and drizzle with a touch of oil before blending. Play around by adding garlic, capers, pickled shallots, or anything else you have on hand. *Recipe* 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil 1/2 cup minced mixed fresh herbs (parsley, basil, dill, thyme) 3 tablespoons white wine vinegar (or lemon juice) 2 tablespoons honey and/or dijon mustard -- **Chia Dressing:** Chia seeds will thicken any liquid, so letting them work their magic on whatever your favorite flavors are turns them into a salad dressing. Mix ingredients, like blueberry and lemon juice, or orange juice and chopped chipotle peppers in adobo, and then let sit for an hour with the seeds before stirring and serving. *Recipe:* 3:1 oil and vinegar ratio 2 teaspoons chia seeds 1 teaspoon mustard (dijon or whole grain) 1 teaspoon honey Salt and pepper to taste",
      "This is why I love this sub. Exactly what I am looking for. Even though I have been fortunate enough not to worry about how much to spend on groceries I am trying to instill in my kids an appreciation for good, simple food that you can make yourself. This is wonderful. Will be making the green goddess dressing with my daughter tomorrow. Thank you.",
      "Love the Araucana eggs in the pic. People always get so confused by them. Home made condiments are the best. You can just keep a base of ingredients in the fridge, and then be super flexible with what you make for dinner. Plus, they are always better and tastier too. My mind boggles at people buying store bought tartare, apple sauce, etc, when home made is super simple and easy. Same with salad dressings, I\u2019ve had people over for dinner that lose their minds over the salad dressing, and it\u2019s like 3 ingredients that everyone already has",
      "(For the creamy category?) I usually cheat by making a 25/75% mayo/sour cream (light/9%) mix, and then start from there: * Add sweet french mustard to taste to make french hot-dog dressing. * Add ketchup or BBQ sauce to taste to make a great burger dressing. (Edit: add liquid smoke if that's your thing) * Add garlic and/or chives to taste to make a fresh sour-cream dressing. * Do your own experiments, while tasting all along. In the end, make it taste perfect with a bit of lemon juice, sugar, salt and pepper. It may not be easy to make it a lot cheaper (than store bought, per liter), unless you make wholesale amounts, but there's sure less fats and sugars than in the store bought... only caveat is that a sour cream dressing doesn't have a very long shelf life after mixed. On the other hand, when I've bought ready made dressings it's usually for a specific dish or occation, then I end up throwing away half a bottle, because we don't eat the same dish 4-5 days in a row. So, in the long run I believe we save money on making smaller specific portions, fit for what we're having that day. When that's said, I see in one of your recipes you replace mayo with greek youghurt... They're not even close to each other in taste... is this just a matter of taste, or trying to make it lower fat? because then I could recommend trying with mixing mayo with skyr (icelandic youghurt), greek youghurt, fraiche (low fat creme fraiche) or actual creme fraiche. I do prefer to use full-fat mayo (40%), so any of those will lower the fat content when mixed in, but IF one isn't too keen on the sour tastes of the low-fat youghurts, they may find some of the other products to be just the way they like.",
      "Love your description of Thousand Island: \"like an overturned condiment cart\", haha. It's my favorite, I will have to try out your recipe. Just curious, is there a common substitute for white wine vinegar? I think it's the only thing I dont have on hand right now. Have apple cider vinegar, and white vinegar, i think. Thanks!"

      "You\u2019re totally right for the most part, but you can still get some good deals at some fast food places. I feel like they have actually become more affordable lately. There was definitely a spike there for a time where it seemed like... for a fast food meal combo... if you spent a dollar more you could eat at a real restaurant. If you do it right though... fast food can still win. 1. Don\u2019t buy the meals. The drinks you\u2019re paying for are a total waste and a rip off when factored into the meal price. Unless you really need something to drink, like you\u2019re actually eating in the car while driving or something I\u2019d say always skip. 2. Actually look for deals. Beyond just \u201cnumber 3 \u201c combo or whatever, a lot of places have other stuff. Coupons are actually a good value too. They never used to seem worth it, but a two for one coupon means each is half price. Some examples of the better combos though... the five dollar boxes are a decent deal compared to the regular numbered combos. Three 5 dollar boxes will get you between 9 and 12 items depending on what box deal they have. That\u2019ll feed a small family for 15 bucks. I don\u2019t know if every McDonalds has it, but near me you can get 2 Big Macs, two fries, and 20 nuggets. Good amount of food for two people for 14.50. 3. Those sides add up. If it\u2019s a family or friends or any group eating and not just you, then skip some fries or onion rings or whatever for everyone and just split them. One fries for two people or whatever you plan on getting. It\u2019s usually enough to get another burger or entree if you just split some sides. Now most of that advice goes for multiple people eating. If it\u2019s just me I can get some sushi or Indian food or anything almost for just a few dollars more.",
      "Every $11 visit to McDonald's would be better spent on a package of meat for me to cook and get 4-6 servings out of it. But I'm in a sea of diners. It is literally nicer to have my choice of eggs made the way I want them, breakfast meat, different style of potatoes and toast/muffin or pancakes/french toast with unlimited refills on my coffee or soda for the same price as a quick run through a drive through. Burger King, McDonald's and the rest are all just as expensive as Panda Express. I may as well get something that's got, well, more bang for my buck. Or frequent the little mom and pop Korean BBQ, Tex Mex or Pho places. Better yet, get a deep fryer and a griddle and have fun replicating your favorite fast food/diner stuff at home. When you want a burger, have Five Guys. Sure, it's more expensive than McDonald's. But it's better. And I'm sorry, Taco Bell lovers, but until I can get a chili relleno there, it's Il Cantina at the end of my block, with all the fresh chips and pico de gallo I wanna eat while I wait for it.",
      "Absolutely spot on, op. We've definitely noticed the same in our family. As such we've changed our dine-out habits completely. Whenever we're craving burgers, we skip the fast food joints and instead hit the mom and pop burger joints. The prices are at worst on par to BK or McD, but the quality of the food is miles above. The taco truck vendors have incredible food for ridiculously cheap as well. If you want quality Mexican food, avoid the tex mex locales and instead peruse your local Mexican grocery marts. They won't always advertise it, but usually they have a restaurant/deli style counter where you can order authentic plates to go. Mole, pozole, menudo, caldo de rez, quality burritos, tacos with hand made tortillas. And for CHEAP. We've also discovered a gold mine of locals selling incredible food over social media. Just join one of your local buy/sell groups on FB or Insta and you'll usually find people selling home made food. Only downsides we've had are that a lot of the vendors are cash only, or only sell food during specific days of the week, etc. But we've yet to be disappointed by the variety, quality or price. Mexican, Indian, Japanese, Chinese dishes, seafood platters, you name it, all for super reasonable prices and you're helping out your community instead of corporate fat cats. I'm all for trends like these! Hyper-localized businesses are fascinating and I hope they catch on.",
      "At times when I need to lose weight, I'll eat half of a restaurant meal (or less, depending on the size) and save the other half for a second meal. Especially if you find dishes you genuinely like but which are also healthy and filling. Great advice, thanks!",
      "Man taco bell was always the cheapest fast food option to me, since I get the $5 cravings box with two entrees, a side, and a drink. Really good value and keeps me full for a long time. Then my boyfriend moved in, and his order is like $15-20 just for himself \ud83d\ude05 I know it would be better to just go to a real restaurant if I'm paying like $25 for fast food for two people but......dang if taco bell aint tasty tho"

You can get more food at Taco Bell guaranteed than you can at a restaraunt for the same price if you utilize the value menu, which is what I do most of time because its cheap and for $5 I can get 5 items. That being said drive through times got messed up by covid, if your Taco Bell is fully open or any fast food really try inside. Most people are refusing to go inside now and only doing drive thru so they back up the line, then complain about it when there\u2019s an empty lobby with a 2-3 minute wait. If I see 5 cars I go in and I\u2019m gone within 5 minutes, 10 of its real bad that day.",
      "Fast food used to make some sense to me - it was fast and affordable to offset how unhealthy and mediocre tasting it was. Now it seems slower, pricier, smaller, less tasty and just as unhealthy. And there are fewer workers who are more miserable. We reserve it for road trips when there aren\u2019t other options.",
      "Literally ever since fast food stopped being significantly cheaper, it feels like such a poor choice. Not saving money, not feeling healthy post meal, not enjoying good tastes other than salt. Meh",

      "I think that many comments here are taking the extreme, doing your bread off course is time consuming , but chap fast health foods are not that. I love to cook but I hate to clean dishes and wasting time cooking , I still need to work ,study , have Hobbys and play, we all have our time but there is still a lot of cheap fast health food. 1- Roast vegetables , you can use zucchini, eggplant or , peppers or any big medium hard vegetable (no potatoes,or similar , cut them in long meat like prices, put amooor of your favorite cheese on top to add flavor ,protein and fats, and roast them dry in a pan , you can add.oil if you want but is better than not, you just need to cook them by 5 to 10 min, it depends how you like , maybe you favorite spice on top and ready , eat while warm, is a very light meat also if you are trying to control what you eat. 15 min max 2- soup , do a heavy bean soup, I use lents and quinoa, if you want to go gourmet use also your favorite broth , leave the soup cooking for half hour and go and play videogames or any other things, is also a good moment to clean kitchen or wash dishes or put a laundry basket. Add vegetables if you like but if you soup has beans or lents it will already have a lot of proteins to fill your hunger. Pro multicultural tip, in many countries we add bananas, pineapple or bacon to the beans/lents soup for give a touch of diferente flavor 3- broth . Is Sunday midday , you are going to rest and bench watch your netflix series, before that cut in half 2 carrots, a full onion, a full garlic head, 1 celery stick , trow all that in a big boiling pot, add water , and maybe your favorite bone meat, chicken , beef pork or nothing and just do it with vegetables. Let it boil in low fire , go and be a coach potato, each time that you need to refill your drink or go to pee church the broth, go back to the coach and see all that season , there you cook a 8 hours traditional broth while you use your time as you like. In general there is a lot of slow cooking foods that can be leave cooking while you put attention in another thing And also go outside of your comfort zone , many diferent cultures have fast healthy cheap foods , try mexican simple quesadillas, russian kasha , caucas or Indian food also have fast options, even the cl\u00e1sic european bread/meat/pickle can be a good fast option. And don't forget to be a vanguardista fusion cheff, if you can't get that exotic spice, that strange but, or that fancy cheese use something not your local area that is similar",

      "I love to cook but by the time I add up planning a list, shopping/picking up, food prep, cooking, putting away stuff and cleaning, it is work that sometimes I don't want to do after my construction job. The bf doesn't know how to cook so he does help with cleaning. I'd say we were doing 50/50 me cooking and him paying for delivery or going out per state guidelines. Trying to get that to 75/25 to save money even though it's extra work for me. I absolutely do not feel bad about going out to eat. There are a lot of really good small business restaurants in my area with fair priced food. We like to go out and try new things and have some drinks. If you tip well enough, you even get a couple on the house. Plus we are supporting the community. And I get to relax after work and that's GD priceless.",
      "This goes for everything! I try to explain this to people obsessed with saving money and who will go to great lengths to do it: what is your time worth? What are you paid per hour? But more accurately: What would you pay yourself per hour (being reasonable both ways)? This is key! They say time equals money right? Many would say time is greater than money and it is indirectly what your striving to buy from the money you have earned. This has to be the most considered part of every economical equation and should be made intuitive so that you never get away for the main reason behind every striving. Even if what you want is to work more, that is also time that you wish to buy. Of course we have the primary needs of survival but right after that we seem to be interested in some form of freedom and I would even say that they\u2019re more parallel than hierarchical so long as you\u2019re not living in the poorest of conditions. This goes for both directions of economic actions, both buying and earning; if you want to sacrifice even more time than you are currently doing for some reward in the future - being it monetary or perhaps a dream within that line of work - then this same consideration has to be done as well and maybe even more so. This might sound childishly obvious to some reader and you\u2019re right! But still, look around, how many seem to thinking like this in are society today? And out of the ones that are aware of this, how many are keeping up this system with consistency and integrity?",
      "Absolutely. There are convenience staples I will pay money for every time. A lot of them are situational (when postpartum meal prep runs out, I'm not hand-making noodles for a while - Reames go in the grocery cart without apology). I've also tried to discover more uses for appliances and gadgets, like using our secondary 'pot luck' crock pot to make bread (or soap!), IP for apple sauce; useful things that can be prepared pretty much unattended so I can 'double' my time. Factoring in the cost of our time is a good life practice. Small business owners do it, artists do it- successful ones, certainly. Whether it's more valuable to be paid in time or money is different for everyone, and no one should feel frugal guilt for what suits them best."

      "Looks great! I started making cold brew tea a few months ago and it's super easy. I just put some tea bags right into a pitcher of cold water and leave it for at least 12 hours in the 'fridge. Sometimes I'll throw some sliced lemon in there. Super easy and super cheap (five tea bags is like ten cents). You can even get a second brew out of the teabags, just refill the jug on the second day. Cold brew is great because hot water will pull tannins from the tea leaves giving the tea a subtle bitterness. Cold brew does not. It's also easier since you don't have to heat any water. If you use or want to start using loose leaf tea I found these disposable empty paper teabags that you can fill with loose leaf tea, tie off and toss into your jug. Super easy to do and to clean up. Last bit of advice if you sweeten your tea is to make simple syrup. Just heat up a cup of water with a cup of sugar on the stove until it turns totally clear. It dissolves in cold liquids much more easily than sugar or honey.",

Also, I can recommend drinks like iced tea and \"lemon water\" for people like me who are very impulsive with food and drink and snack/drink a lot at home.

Also make sure to wash the veggies before you cut them or your broth will have a dirt flavor. I save herb bits, stalks as well for added flavor.

      "Good advice. As a rule, eat the fridge and fresh stuff first. If you have too much of something to eat it (or you're sick of it), throw it in the freezer. (I had two Costco bags of broccoli that I froze, for example--just plop it in boiling water for 30 seconds, cool, then put it in the freezer.) Then eat your freezer. Then eat your shelf stable foods. Only use shelf stable foods as needed to use up the fresh stuff. If you have food on the verge of spoiling like dairy, make a cake or quick bread. You can also sub in yogurt or sour cream if you need to use up that stuff. Any meat or produce on the verge, make a soup or stew. Unless something is visibly moldy or slimy, it won't kill you as long as you cook it long enough! One other thing, though: you may want to mix in a can of chicken or tuna here and there and save a few meals of your frozen meat because once it's all gone, you may get mighty sick of eating canned meats and greatly appreciate those chicken thighs (or whatever).",

Use Avocado oil, very similar in nutrition, with a 450 \u201csmoke\u201d point, instead where the nutrition won\u2019t boil off. Tip for using olive oil on pasta: Don\u2019t cook it off. In a sauce, do the sauce in the pan first, add the pasta in the last 2-3 minutes of its cooking cycle, and cook in the sauce (add a bit more water a couple of tablespoons\\ max, if needed, to let the pasta absorb and cook properly). When the pasta is perfect al dente, turn off the heat. THEN put in all of that good EVOO. You get the full flavor, all of the nutrients."

Someone suggested I skip the water and just use as much oil as needed to make a stiff dough. It made the dough so slippery that it didn't want to feed through the rollers or the cutting die. The trick, if you want to call it that, it to add only just enough moisture to form a stiff dough. Resting it it half an hour before rolling will make it considerably softer, so it you make it too soft to begin with its apt to be so messy it will clog up your machine. Probably not a huge problem with an electric extrusion machine, but a hand crank machine can be problematic. I used to get quite stressed out about it, now it's second nature.",

It's basically the food version of \"the best exercise is exercise you'll actually do.\") (Edited to add 2: Electric Boogaloo: Don't forget that frozen produce is often actually \"better\" for you than fresh, because it's frozen at peak ripeness instead of spending a lot of time in trucks and on shelves. The textures/flavors might not be as nice because of the way freezing affects the food, but it's often way easier to pull out a bag of frozen mixed veggies than to buy them and chop them up yourself\u2014and you don't have to worry about the produce spoiling if you buy it but then don't have the energy to make anything with it.)",
      ">I wouldn\u2019t go for pre-cut because it\u2019s a waste of money but I find that having a banana or pear ready to go is really helpful. Look, if you're struggling just to take care of your needs, and you're too anxious to chop a fruit, and that hesitation leads that fruit to rot and you grab some candy to eat instead... pre-cut fruits are a perfectly valid choice. Yes, it costs a little more and has some extra packaging, but you have to weigh those downsides against your own priorities. It's a valid option. The reason I say this is because I have a long history of guilting myself over food choices. Do whatever you gotta do to make those healthy choices. In fact, it's good to make those healthy choices EASIER so that it's easier to choose them.",

      "Trader Joe\u2019s everything bagel seasoning goes on everything. It\u2019s amazing in breakfasts, roasted meats, basically any savory Asian dish, etc. Another tip for depressive breakfasts is to make your own parfaits.

Mix it in the yogurt container even (like a Chobani) and you\u2019ve got a simple, filling, and healthy breakfast without making any effort. I would also mention that as a food lover, cooking helps me curb my lows. So while it\u2019s great to have all of these easy fixes, it may help you to take the time to make yourself a real treat. Not only does it taste amazing, but between the positive feelings of productivity and satisfaction in knowing you\u2019re capable I truly found myself feeling a little less shitty."

My husband will sometimes add different hot sauces too. \ud83d\udc49How to make dippy eggs whose whites are cooked, yolks are runny, and edges are crispy (my fave): -Grab a skillet and heat it on med-high (I do 7 out of 10 on the knob). -When hot, drop a tbsp or less of butter on there (should immediately sizzle) and spread it around. -Crack your egg(s) into the buttered area. Cook for a minute maybe, not too long, just until the whites START to firm on the underside. -Cut eggs apart if needed, flipping each separately to be careful to not pop them. -Cook for 30ish seconds.

Favorite use for leftover rotisserie chicken. And food tastes SO much better, it isn't even funny! Have been making Tom kha and Tom yum quite a bit, love hot and sour, and using stock to cook grains and finish pasta to al dente. Soup is the answer! Cheap, easy, healthy, filling. I very much relate to the ability to just keep dumping healthy stuff in. I love adding frozen veg at the end, as well, to bump up nutrition - spinach and kale are particularly great but don't add too much or you'll affect overall flavor.",
      "tbh I think it's a long-standing stigma thats developed into culture. \"Soup Kitchen\" is a stigmatized concept and has been for a long time, so a complete meal that satisfies and nourishes _has_ to be plate-ready food vs something you can ladle into a bowl. Soups exist and are appreciated, but as an accompaniment or appetizer - never a main course. I love soup - I've adored it since I was small and I will into old age. Soup can be as light or as heavy as you like and it can contain literally anything your heart desires. You can make it light, heavy, spicy, sweet, hot, cold, you can dip buttered bread in it, scoop it with tortillas, dump crackers, fresh rice, shredded cheese, heavy cream, noodles, more noodles after you finish the first batch, _STILL MORE NOODLES_, dumplings, fried potatoes, fried onions, literally ANYTHING into it and it'll make it what you want. Soup is like the ultimate meal in my opinion because ontop of feeding you: it effing _hydrates_ you. Do you know how dry I am because I forget to drink water on a regular basis? Soup covers hunger _and_ thirst in one swoop. Soup is bomb af. **EDIT: The most recent soup I made was the result of being hungry, tired, and just generally low on ingredients. It was about 3 or 4 cups water, a Not Beef bouillon cube, a can of V8, some black pepper, salt, some cumin, a lump of cream cheese, two eggs, a splash of lemon, a healthy shot of sriracha, and lastly some chickpea flour to thicken (about 1/4th cup). Bring water to a good simmer, add bouillon and whisk until dissolved. Add V8. Add eggs and whisk vigorously to avoid anything solidifying; you want a thick broth, nothing to chew. Once this is done add the lemon juice and sriracha, then spices, then cream cheese (you want to be whisking the entire time so nothing sticks at the bottom of the pot). In a small bowl add the chickpea flour then enough water to make a slurry; whisk then add in, then whisk some more. As it simmers/lightly boils (dont let it full on boil because it'll make a mess) you'll notice it thickens; you want it to develop legs when you lift the whisk out (not quite to gravy consistency, but close. If the soup starts to break it means you added too much lemon juice or you cooked it too much).. Figure between 2 and 5 minutes it should be just shy of a nice thick broth and you're done. Taste, season further if necessary, serve. I just call it \"Fortified Broth\" because it's liquid but filling and satisfying. Goes great with a slice of buttered bread.",

My fav was made with a stock made from a fish carcus ( after eating tge filets thr day before). She would drain out the bones and put them back in the sea. Then add tubers and roots she dug up, tikiski and yukka (casaba), ginger and galangal chopped to the fish stock. She would throw in some wild culantro, and a handfull of lemongrass tied in a knot to remove before serving. The best part was going out and picking up a coconut off the beach taking the husk off with a stake wedged in the ground and then grating it. She had a special tool fir this called a chuso. It was a piece of wood that she sat on and it had an old machette blade with saw tooths cut into it which came out between her legs. she would then crack the coconut in half with the back of a machettes, save tge water from it and grate each half on the sawblade. For a rich soup she would use two coconuts. She took the grated coconut and squeezed thr milk out wihile rinsing with a little water. The result was super creamy coconut milk. She added this to the fish soup just before serving. Most people added a little chili sauce. Her name is Paulina and she is a fucking fantastic. Don't get me started on her tamales!!"

I am so with you on having days where if I have to lift a finger to generate breakfast, breakfast is not happening.",
      "I'm puzzled as to why cold cereal has gone so out of fashion that people don't even think of it as a breakfast option anymore. A bowl of generic unsweetened shredded wheat gives me 15 grams of protein and 8 grams of fiber and costs 67 cents per serving. Add a banana or apple and you've got a very nutritionally sound and inexpensive meal. There are a number of other high fiber/no sugar or low sugar cereals out there, like Fiber One. Even Cheerios are fine - whole grain, low sugar and some fiber. Granola is almost always a sugar vehicle with little nutritional value, and I avoid Frankensoy products except on occasion. For extra protein, a cup of soy milk is a cheaper and less processed option than TVP. And of course, Greek yogurt and cottage cheese are high protein, low calorie and require no cooking."

      "I intentionally acquired the taste for sardines\u2014I didn\u2019t like them initially. My first tip is to (at least initially) buy sardine cans in the $1.50-$2.50 range from an international grocery store instead of the cheapest available (beach cliff, chicken of the sea, great value, etc) at your regular grocery. The bottom tier of sardines are way lower quality than the cheap imports, so paying even 50 cents more can make a huge difference in your enjoyment. Once you\u2019ve acquired the taste, you might want to switch to the cheap stuff, but until then, the low end imports are your best option. Have you tried sardines in oil or a flavorful sauce instead of water? I can\u2019t do sardines in water, but I love the $1.99 cans of Sultan sardines in olive oil with chili peppers. Also worth noting that the sardines in tomato sauce/other sauces are meant to be heated before serving, whereas the sardines in oil are good cold from the can. Asian a rule, Asian sardines are also intended to be heated, and are best when added to a rice cooker 5-10 minutes before the rice is done. Another big tip is that the skinless/boneless sardines actually taste fishier! I recommend going for the big hunk sardines (brisling) over the little ones (sprats). You can easily peel the skin off/debone the big ones yourself if the skin/bones give you the ick. I also recommend adding them to other stuff. They\u2019re great in chunks in pasta with red sauce, or on sandwiches with tomato slices, labneh cheese, and scallions. If you keep with it and keep trying different kinds, you\u2019ll be a regular sardine lover soon enough.",
      "This is probably going to be unpopular....but I like them with lots of mustard and some good quality ketchup. Or BBQ sauce, like Sweet Baby Ray's. I don't like the taste of them, but they're a great source of protein and vitamin D. So strong sauce is good on them lol.",
      "It's worth recognizing that not all sardines are the same fish! Just learning this myself, and it makes a lot of sense of why I like some brands more than others. They're different species. There are a bunch of small fish that get called sardines, but the big common split people seem to talk about is brisling vs. pilchard. I definitely seem to prefer the pilchards. So maybe figure out what you're currently eating and see if you like the other better. You can also have options like skinless and boneless. Less cheap, but I found a foil-pouch brand of smoked trout on Amazon that is excellent.",
      "I love sardines (matiz is my fave) but I find that not all brands are to my liking (price point does matter in this case) I mash with a squeeze of lemon and some capers and put on avocado toast with some fresh herbs and tomato But sometimes you just don\u2019t like a food\u2026and that is also ok",
      "Do you like canned tuna? I usually mix Greek yogurt, pickles, celery, any seasonings, Dijon mustard, ect into mine and make a sardine salad and put on anything. It\u2019s a mindset. I think if you never grow up with this fish you would be hesitant to eat it. But it\u2019s incredibly good for you. That and mackerel, anchovies\u2026.i only get them in water, although some people love them in olive oil. I usually eat about 3 or so cans a week. Incredible health benefits."

      "Honestly, you don't have to have meat. I'm not here to change your mind, though. If it's something you want to eat more of, think about ways you can get that meat into the dishes you're interested in. Think lasagna, a bolognese sauce (bonus for both: you can easily add veggies like zucchini and carrots to these!), and maybe some hearty, sweet-adjacent meals like tamale pie, chili, and sweet potato stew. Lots of veggies go well with sweet things. Zucchini bread, pumpkin pudding, carrot cake... I actually love a carrot salad (think fine shredded carrot, crushed pineapple, shredded coconut, and walnuts, with or without raisins), and zucchini-noodle bowls have gotten really popular (zucchini spirals, sweet red bell peppers, mint, cilantro, peanut sauce, tofu or chicken, and edamame).",

      "Sweet is a tough one - a lot of veggies (eg carrots) actually taste sweet if you\u2019re not used to eating sweet things, but if you have a lot of sugar in your diet already you can\u2019t taste it. One example: carrots are where the plant stores the sugar it makes through photosynthesis. If you\u2019re up for a longer-term project, reduce the overly sweet stuff in your diet gradually, and see what starts to taste sweet now. For the short-term, I would try roasting some veggies - salt, pepper, olive oil, and a little brown sugar or maple syrup. The more caramelized/brown (but not burnt) they get, the sweeter they taste."

A bag of protein powder maybe expensive when you buy it but overall, the protein you get for that price is about the cheapest protein source you can find. Try this or find your own version.

      "I would focus more on the dish structure like protein,carbs and nutrients. I also took a break from peppers for some reason, I just needed a break. I would try to diversity the veggies so you can get a bit from everything. I will give you some examples of meal prep ideas,super fast where you can see you can just forget about peppers for a bit. This is an example, https://youtu.be/lxMO9tDL1aM?si=Pyirw5BjJZEENRxO (Broccoli is rich in: Vitamin C (immunity, skin) Vitamin K (bone health, blood clotting) Folate (cell repair, especially important during pregnancy) Fiber (digestion, heart health) Potassium (blood pressure regulation)) Another simple alternative https://youtu.be/Jla8iay99_U?si=6KxoScB9EIQ7JLHh High in Nutrients Rich in vitamins A, C, and K Contains folate, manganese, and fiber Low in calories (about 30\u201335 calories per cup cooked)) I would focus more on cherry tomatoes,eggplant, carrots, sweet potatoes,zukkini and after you get tired of those you can might crave the peppers. I hope it was helpful.\ud83d\ude0a",
      "I know you say it's the taste, but is texture also an issue? For example, I really dislike jarred red peppers, am okay with sauteed peppers and freaking love them if charred or grilled (or done like in fajitas, whatever that magic is). Somehow, making them less watery is magic. Some people also really hate the skins, which can be charred off on the grill or over a gas stove pretty easily. If it's really just the taste that incurs rage, bell/sweet peppers are mainly a good source of vitamin C, which is easy to get from citrus (and easy to absorb from vitamins if you don't like fruit). They're not particularly great sources of fiber or protein - they're mainly in recipes because people like them and they bulk up meals without adding a ton of calories. Zucchini, eggplant, mushrooms, and tomatoes would act pretty similarly as far as cooking times and calories (mushroom might need more liquid added, tomatoes a bit less). If the peppers are a minor component, leaving them out is also fine. If you want a hint of sweetness without the bell pepper flavor, tomato paste is a good substitute.",
      "After going through your comments I believe you're trying to make chili without jalapenos or bell peppers. Onion, garlic, tomatoes, and even corn are pretty present. I love making slow cooker chili and here's what I recommend: Pick your onion of choice. Quarter ring slice: add early as a texture replacement for peppers. Diced, large: add before final simmer. (maybe an hour, tops). Diced, small: upon serving (raw, crunchy!) Garlic, fresh ground or diced add halfway through. Tomatoes can be added later as well. Corn is totally forgiving, add early for softer, later for firmer texture. Celery, carrots, sweet potatoes are good too. My mother couldn't handle ANY spice, so I had to tailor chili for her. She also hated bell peppers, so I sauteed and kept on the side to add to my own bowl. I do tons of stuff in the slow cooker. Today I put in a whole chicken with little more than a few herbs and chicken broth and leftover frozen veggies. Last week I did taco meat, and ribs before that. On average I use the slow cooker twice a week.",
      "I, too, abhor bell peppers. I have found the small sweet peppers edible, they don\u2019t look like bell peppers and don\u2019t have that offensive green flavor in them, try those before you cook with them though! They usually are red, orange and yellow. Do you have the same issue with yellow bell peppers? They\u2019re the least offensive of the bell peppers for me. For other options, you can use a vegetable peeler on carrots, parsnips, zucchini, cabbage, or use some sun-dried tomatoes (not packed in oil) depending on the recipe you\u2019re subbing for. Often peppers are with onions and garlic so I\u2019ll usually add extra onion in those recipes in lieu of the peppers addition. Might have good luck with poblanos instead of jalape\u00f1os, I\u2019ve found they work for me. Green Chiles in a can are also a nice lightly spicy sub if you don\u2019t like jalape\u00f1os, I\u2019ll use the canned green chilis in Mexican sauces instead of jalape\u00f1os. Totally if they\u2019re for texture I\u2019ll lean towards cabbage or carrot ribbons as a pepper sub. If they\u2019re for flavor, I\u2019ll try a roasted poblano or the small sweet peppers or just the extra onion. Good on you for branching out and trying new things!",
      "Don't forget about zucchinis, squash, or eggplant. Great thing about all of these is that they have a very mild flavor and they tend to absorb the flavors that are cooked around them specially eggplant. One of the greatest things I've told friends when their experimenting to try to get into new vegetables and fruit is to eat with the season. So whatever season you're currently experiencing and you're part of the world see what's currently in season buy those things and try those things and the next season that happens try what's in season. This gives you multiple seasons multiple things to try during each season to find out what you like what tastes good with what you're cooking."

      "Absolute struggle meal moments in my life: When my parents abandoned me and I was homeless as a teen, I stayed in school and kept it a secret (I thought I would be in trouble and that they'd take me away from my high school friends and band--which was what kept me hanging in there). I also thought school was the only way out. I would eat leftovers from friends at the lunch table. The last bite of their sandwich or banana. Whatever any of them wanted to give me. A couple of friends realized I was struggling and would often save me something or give me their chips, etc. I also discovered the band director's office had a dish of hard candies you could take--so I'd grab a couple of those. I just couldn't bring myself to eat out of the trash, but I remember grabbing food from plates at this outdoor restaurant patio that people had not finished. They looked like clean people, and they'd left a bunch of untouched dinner rolls and one whole taco. lol. Also during this window of homelessness, I'd get food from a church that was often unusable (canned goods with no can opener, flour with no way for me to cook or prep it, etc.). But when I got jars of peanut butter or cheap jelly, I could keep them in my bag and eat spoonfuls here and there. I would also sometimes be able to get a few dollars and get fries from McDonalds, or one of those mini green or red burritos from Taco Bell (this is back in the early 90s) and I'd grab extra sauce or ketchup packets to eat later. Later, as an adult (still impacted by poverty and a lack of familial resources), there have been times when I had to eat a cold struggle meal with no electricity, etc. But my most common adult struggle meals (with access to a stove or microwave) have been cheap ramen + a bag of frozen veggies, rice + furikake seasoning, canned beans, a tub of tofu (stretched over several days).

I'd argue that mise-en-place isn't always the best option - when there's a long cook time for part of the dish, you can prep ingredients for the next step.

      "My family makes \"Kirschmichl\", I think it's from northern Germany. It's a sweet dish you can make even with really old, bone dry bread that is hard as a rock. Can't give any ingredient amounts, but I've always eyeballed it and it turned out great. You cut, saw or rip the bread into chunks and soak it in a mix of milk, egg yolks and sugar. You add cherries and then you beat the egg whites and carefully fold them in. Put everything in a casserole dish, sprinkle some sugar on top and some almond flakes if you like. Put it in the oven until it's golden brown on top and serve it with ice cream, whipped cream, custard or vanilla sauce. If you make a large batch, it can easily be frozen and reheated in the microwave, but it does taste best fresh out of the oven.",
      "Bread salad (like panzanella) is a great non-oven option, just cube the bread, let it soak up tomato juices, olive oil, vinegar, and toss in onions, cucumbers, maybe some herbs. Super fresh, no cooking, and uses a good chunk of leftover bread.",

      "My wife and I do meal planning once a week. Inventory > plan > shopping list > shopping > cook. When my wife and I sit down to plan seven dinners we usually each come to the table with a couple of dozen ideas. Cooking for one is challenging. See r/CookingForOne. Scaling is hard. Long ago I made proteins a couple of times a week, carbs a couple of times, veg and/or salad the rest of the time. A little weird but I lived. \\*grin\\* A freezer helps a lot. You can portion so that you can space out leftovers. Leftovers mean less cooking. Off the top of my head, and with recipes available, some ideas to renew your inspiration complete with stories to generate interest. Lasagna. I'm of English/German/Ukrainian heritage. My wife's very Italian family loves my lasagna. My FIL born in Trieste says it reminds him of his grandmother's except mine is better. Chicken tikka masala. Actually from the UK, based on butter chicken. Classic pub food. When I lived in the UK I schmoozed publicans who introduced me to their kitchens who helped me develop my recipe. Tibetan momos. My sister is an honest to goodness Buddhist lama. I learned this from real Tibetan Buddhist monks in the retinue of Tai Situ Rinpoche who led the Karmapa sect until the Karmapa came of age. Spaghetti puttanesca a la Angelfish. This recipe came from a sailing colleague. Best when eaten in the cockpit of a sailboat anchored somewhere beautiful. Thai shrimp curry. Learned from my late SIL who learned from her mother and grandmother sitting on the ground in Thailand cooking over a charcoal brazier. Adapted for American kitchens and grocery stores by Lamoun. Cock-a-leekie soup. Another UK pub acquisition. Chicken and leeks. I hope this has been of some assistance. I'll be here all week. [Please tip your waitress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtUK1-ETKwg&t=58s).",
      "Sometimes it's okay to just eat simple food - when I'm really unmotivated I often ask myself what I would make for lunch rather than dinner - we put a lot less pressure on the midday meal for some reason. When I was growing up my mom would make me snack plates that I make myself now when I'm tired (or too hot to cook): sliced apples, carrots, celery, grapes, etc. all arranged like flowers, with slices of sharp cheddar on the apples/carrots. It's pretty, it's simple, it takes a couple of minutes to make, and it's very healthy. You can add nuts, cold cuts, olives, hummus - anything you want to graze on. But not every meal has to be cooked, or complicated. Alternately, if you WANT inspiration, I love watching travel/food shows to learn about cuisines I may not have even heard of before. Where I grew up there was a lot of multicultural food, but quite a lot of places in the world never made it there as immigrants (or at least not in sufficient numbers to create pockets of restaurants/shops). I've recently started learning about Georgian food after seeing a great episode of Somebody Feed Phil on Georgia. I know he's not everyone's cup of tea, but it can be any good travel show that piques your interest and appetite. Paul Hollywood did a baking travel show a while ago that was on Youtube and it introduced me to Norway in a completely new way. If you can go out, try new restaurants, ideally smaller family-run ones so you don't break the bank. The best inspiration comes from experiences :)",
      "Super easy dinners: Get a cast iron fry pan. Always have frozen vegetables on hand, like broccoli and cauliflower. Check out the sale-refrigerator when you visit the grocery store, that's where they put items that are half-off because the sell-by date is today. Get some deals and bring meat & fish home to put in the freezer. It is so easy to put some frozen broccoli in the frypan, bake it in the oven for 15 minutes, then put in some salmon darnes and bake for another 15 minutes. There you are, easy dinner. Works just as well for breaded fish or fish-cakes. Sausages are another easy meal. Put sausages, cauliflower, broccoli in the fry pan, then bake for half an hour at 180C. Dinner's ready!",
      "I learn to do something fiddly, or something that improves kitchen efficiency or reduces waste or consumption of single use plastic, and it reinvigorates me. For example, a few years ago I learned how to turn four limes into like 8 cups of lime juice by making superjuice. It lit a fire! When I learn recipes, I'm not trying to learn an instruction set for a single dish -- I'm looking for principles and flavor combinations I can apply elsewhere. I don't just want a list of dishes I can whip up, I want to be able to innovate on the fly. Many years ago I attended an Indian cooking workshop, and later spent time with people who knew how to prepare Middle Eastern dishes. These experiences made it possible for my partner and I to pull off a \"Pilgrims and Indians\" Thanksgiving with Middle Eastern and Indian reinterpretations of classic fishes -- turkey saag and cranberry-tamarind chutney were the highlights. Once I made roasted red pepper cream of coconut soup just riffing off an online recipe idea. HOLY SHIT GOOD. Ramping up the degree of difficulty is just immensely fun for me now. I wish I knew how to plate better, to make dishes extra pretty.",

      "I do a combo - I get some frozen stuff (orange chicken, popcorn chicken, etc.) for nights when I want to cook, but also want to make it easy on myself (with the orange chicken, I usually do fried rice with it which is where I get to do some cooking, but then it\u2019s easy on the dishes and cooking) \u2026 the frozen/pantry stuff can stay in the freezer/pantry for several weeks/months without going bad - so I usually keep some of that on hand With fresh stuff, I\u2019m usually going to the store 2x a week - once Mondays and once on Friday/Saturday - for that, I usually have planned out what I\u2019m going to cook on what days and then make sure to get the ingredients I need for those specific meals - so like this week, I planned out chicken Marsala for tonight - so I got chicken breast, mushrooms, and broccolini - but I already have the stuff for polenta on hand (my other side) - I\u2019m pretty stoked for tonight - and then this weekend, I\u2019m kinda thinking about doing mushroom pate with some sort of protein - or maybe a mushroom steak? But I\u2019ll plan out the dinner first - then head to the fancy grocery store that\u2019s 30 mins away to get the fancy mushrooms \u2026 That\u2019s the other thing - the grocery store that\u2019s two blocks down (H\u2011E\u2011B) is pretty good - but they don\u2019t have an extensive collection (i.e. they have white and portabella mushrooms, but I want some porcini and cremini for the mushroom pate) \u2026 so I go to H\u2011E\u2011B on Mondays for the basics - and when I\u2019m feeling fancy, I make the 30 min drive to Central Market which has a sign that they import something like 90% of their stock from Italy? Haha - I LOVE shopping there - their produce section is SOOO extensive and their product is so fresh/tasty - it\u2019s pretty close to farmer\u2019s market quality \u2026 but during the week/rush hour, it\u2019s more like a 45 min to an hour drive, so \u2026 no.

      "For most of the US, the population is more spread out across the landscape, and there are fewer urban centers, especially urban centers that still contain all the businesses necessary for survival. Most people in the US live further away from a large centralized grocery store, rather than living near a lot of smaller shops, and so it\u2019s more convenient to only go to the store once a week or less, rather than having to make multiple lengthy trips. When I live near a good store, I often buy less, more often. When I live further away, I go less often and buy more in one trip. Either way, however, I like to have a general plan for what I am eating before I go shopping, to prevent me from overbuying or having to throw out something that looked good but I never figured out what to do with it. Sometimes my plan is specific, I have an exact recipe in mind and need those exact ingredients. Lots of times the plan is a little more flexible. I need a green vegetable but it doesn\u2019t matter which one. I want some fruit but I am happy to get whatever is in season and on sale. Sometimes something looks really good or there\u2019s a great sale at the store, and I change my plan on the fly. But I like to have at least a vague idea of what I am there for. Big grocery stores can be a little overwhelming for me, so I need a plan to help me stay on track.",
      "I live in the suburbs of a large us city and have multiple options close by, at least by car. I do what is usually a bigger run once a week, and this trip is the most planned - I scour the weekly sales, and digital coupons, evaluate what I have in the freezer and have a loose plan of what we'll be eating for the next few days. At least once a week, usually on a different day, I'll go to at least one other store for specific items such as fresh bread or a great sale item from another grocery chain. I'll also regularly go to Asian and Hispanic markets for good deals, specific items and produce. In the summer, I love going to a farm market (not a farmer's market - it's a small store ~10 miles away that sells produce from a large farm) on the weekend. In the fall, I regularly visit a small farmer who sells beautiful squash and a few other vegetables, which is a 30 minute drive. These trips are often less planned - I eat a lot of produce and sometimes get inspired while I'm there and figure out what I do with whatever impulse buy I picked up There's a notebook where I list all the things I have on hand and a basic plan for what I'll do with them. Recipes and my shopping list are all digital, however.",
      "Before shopping but after doing a pantry inventory of Food I Have Already Paid For. On Monday night I go through the fridge revitalizing soaking water and inspecting for rot, putting things in the \"Use it or lose it\" clear container that lives front and centre of the fridge until Wednesday night (bin night). On Tuesday, I update the inventory (I only do a full inventory of the food in the house every three or four months, because it takes me a while to get through all the beans and rice I have, and I notice pretty quick when there's no eggs. So it's about reminding me that I still have that P.A.N in the cupboard, and noticing that garlic is starting to sprout). So my menu plan is based on using food I already have, throwing in the occasional recipe or cooking technique I want to try. I only really plan the evening meal. Lunch is usually leftovers plus rice/potatoe/pasta and one day soon, P.A.N. I shop and bake/slow cook/sort-of prep (eg. Soak and cook dried beans, chop some veg) on the weekend. I don't menu plan for meal prep day, because I usually have some cheap but unique take-away left over from Market day (the day before or same day) and a treat or two to snack on. I don't make set plans for Tuesday and Wednesday - they are always use-it-or-lose-it box challenges. So my meal plan is just dinners on Thursday, Friday, and the non-market weekends (I plan to shop once a fortnight, but sometimes don't need to shop for three or four weeks) I include any birthdays, parties, potlucks I will be cooking for, and note when I am eating out. Once I have my menu plan, featuring food I have paid for, I go through the recipes looking for bits and pieces I need tto make it. This, added to the list on the fridge of stuff I have run out of, is my first draft shopping list, in the right hand margin of my menu plan. My second draft shopping list (that I have on my phone/in my purse) is created by going through what's on my first draft list, and seeing if I can't substitute something I already have, or live without it this time around. Sometimes, I have to substitute or live without when I get to the shops, too (eg. Eggs all gone due to bird flu, or discount kale instead of half a cabbage for the price of a whole one). I try to only buy as much as I need (eg. 3 carrots, a pepper, a pear, an apple, a beet, an onion, rather than a 2lb bags of carrots, apples and onions, three peppers for the price of two, a bunch of beets with tops attached, and a pear.) In fact, I try to buy a little *less* than I think I'll need. It is cheaper, and it is less likely to end up in the compost, and I always end up with more than I think. Before I get to the cash register, I take everything not on my list out of the basket. I can always get that next time, if I really want it. Typically, the apples on my list turn into pears because pears are cheaper. But sometimes, (eg when trying to recreate an old recipe) it has to be a Winesap, which might involve hunting it down, waiting til October, shelling out more than I normally would spend on an apple. In those rare cases, I only insist on a good crisp apple with the winesap flavor. But most of the time I'm looking at price, nutrition, using what I have, no scrap left behind. And a pear will do.",
      "Most people? Idk, but me and my husband are both working with a toddler and a baby so we decide dinner on the fly on the way home and thus grocery shop for ingredients near daily.

It\u2019s just a toss up of trying to feed ourselves and our toddler a different but hopefully healthy meal while deal with a baby who wants to eat anything but gets. Upset stomach easily at this age. In a perfect world we would plan the week better and shop once a week. I\u2019m trying to work towards a meal prep Sunday. For us and the food we make, it wouldn\u2019t be every 2 weeks because we buy a lot of Whole Foods/produce. It\u2019s not that we couldn\u2019t make that work given that, it\u2019s just that we wind up with weird meal plan changes that don\u2019t make it ideal to have stuff that goes bad in over a week Our grocery is around the corner but it\u2019s not the reason we go daily"

Oh, the mushrooms look sad, but the asparagus is looking nice this week. In your average supermarket I occasionally will run down the freezer section, but mostly I just go around the outside.

I could walk but it's dangerous as we don't have sidewalks in 99% of my town so I have to drive there. So I shop weekly, but I don't have a list outside of a handful of essentials that get replenished whenever they run low. I buy what's in season, on sale, or on clearance, supplement with cheap staples, and then make recipes with what I've got.",
      "In the US I planned beforehand, but just for that one day or maybe the next also. In Germany I have to look around the store before being certain what I can and want to make, because they don't stock produce and meats as fully as the US. Too often I want to make a particular thing but they are missing some of the ingredients. Entire bins of vegetables will just be empty. I dislike having to go all around town to get (hopefully) what I needed, so now I check whichever store I took my chances on and go from there. So, I go to the store pretty much daily, but not Sunday since annoyingly nothing is open. Saturdays have the saddest supply of produce ever, and my family and I don't do mornings well. By the time we get to the store we are screwed.",
      "I plan meals before shopping and go to the store with a grocery list to avoid buying random things that I won\u2019t use. Still, if I see something seasonal or discounted, I adapt the meal plan when I get home. This approach helps me reduce food waste and save money. Also, since I have the week planned out and groceries bought, I won\u2019t panic middle of the week when I\u2019m tired and stressed what to cook - I just check the plan and do the meals"

      "When you do the droplet test, does the water form beads and glide around? If not, the pan's too hot or too cold. If the water splatters and sizzles, it's too cold. If it separates into smaller droplets and evaporates quickly it's too hot. The best way to preheat a stainless steel pan is to let it slowly heat up at a lower temp. Wait a few minutes before adding the oil. When you cook, wait until the meat is ready and comes up easily."

Put a maraschino cherry in the center of each slice on the cream middle. This idea looks great in my head but no idea if it would work in real life lol. Buy (or make) a plain cheesecake. Spread frosting on the side all around, stand the twinkies up and stick them to the frosted sides going all the way around. Fill the top with fruit, or something like cherry pie filling.",

      "Thighs are so great on the grill. I tend to go pretty simple - I just season with some barbecue seasoning. Sometimes I\u2019ll add bbq sauce to finish them. The cooking method that works best for me (on a gas grill) is 2 zone cooking. I preheat the grill on high. Brush the grates on one side with oil. I sear them skin side down on high heat for about 3-5 minutes until browned and crisping. Then turn off the burner on one side. Transfer to a foil pan skin side up, (I might throw in some fresh herbs, garlic cloves and/or lemon here), cook with lid closed on the turned off side for about 20 minutes. They come out great every time.",
      "Skin on bone in? I prefer simple dry spice mix. Salt, pepper, chilli flakes, thyme. You can do this half an hour or so before putting on the grill. More or less is fine. With Skin on, turn often to prevent the skin burning, but with the aim of getting crispy skin eventually. I use a timer and turn every 1.5 to 2 mins with skin on. Depending on how big the thighs are, and how hot your bbq - 15 to 20 (maybe a bit more) mins but use a meat thermometer if you have one to remove guessing. Serve with corn on the cob. Skin off, deboned? My current favourite is tandoori marinade: greek yogurt, oil, butter, ginger (paste is fine), garlic (paste is fine), chilli powder, coriander, cumin, garam masala, turmeric, black pepper, salt, sugar, lemon juice. Marinade overnight or at least 8 hours. Skewer them as flat as possible, hot coals, fast bbq. Serve with home made flat breads (greek yogurt, self-raising flour, some spices - fry in a pan), mint chutney some fresh finely chopped salad number. Thats just the current favourites. You can't go wrong with chicken thighs, they are the best.",
      "You will definitely want to cook them using indirect heat if on the grill or BBQ, render some of the fat off and then give them a nice char and sear over the heat towards the end! Season the night before with whatever you fancy. Overcooked is better than undercooked with thighs as they are very forgiving and better taken to higher temperatures than chicken breast.",

I now have a muffin tin with holes drilled in each cup specifically to repeat this treat. https://www.bbq-brethren.com/threads/cupcake-chicken-thighs-ala-myron-mixon-you-gotta-try-this.124858/",
      "The flavor suggestions are are great and entirely subjective - just choose the your most desirable flavor profile. My suggestion is about technique. I like a dry rub, set on a half sheet pan set over a grate in the fridge the night before. I also buy bone in, skin on. I spend about 30 seconds each to debone, but leave the skin on. I have[ these metal skewers with 2 prongs](https://a.co/d/4yoWiL2). After drybrine in the fridge, I pull them out, skewer them so they're easy to turn and then let stand for about 30 min before grilling. Start skin side down on med low and let that fat render. Brush with sauce towards the end as the sugars will burn on the grill. I mix up the flavor profiles. Sometimes it's fully dry using Tajin for that citrus punch, sometimes it's just seasoned salt with either Kansas City (sticky/sweet) or South Carolina (yellow/sweet/vinegar) style. These turn out great every single time."

      "I thinly slice russet baking potatoes (not perfect), and loosely layer them in the baking dish\u2014nothing fancy just get them in a relatively flat layer. Once they are sliced and in the dish, I take the dish to the kitchen sink, and fill the dish with water just above the potatoes , swish the potatoes around, and pour off the water. I might do this step a second time if it\u2019s a lot of potatoes or a large baking dish. In a big measuring cup, pour around 2 cups (the amount depends on how big of a baking dish & how many potatoes you used) of heavy whipping cream, add a little garlic powder, salt, pepper, and a little pinch of fresh grated nutmeg. Mix the spices in the cream\u2014just a little mix, you\u2019re not whipping it. Pour onto the potatoes so the cream is about even with the top of the potato slices, or just slightly under the top. There should be some visible potatoes at the top, not completely submerged. Put about 1-2 tbsp worth of cubed butter on the potatoes. If you need to add a bit more heavy cream to get near the top of the potatoes, just pour it on. If you want to church it up\u2014sprinkle a little finely shredded Gruy\u00e8re (or any cheese really) on the top, and if you have them, very thinly sliced shallots\u2014just a few slices. Bake at 350 F uncovered, for about 50-60 mins, more or less depending on the size of the dish. When it smells really good, is browned around the edges, it\u2019s done. Let it cool for 10-15 mins to thicken up. This isn\u2019t a strict recipe, it\u2019s a rough guide that always works for me. You could put a small amount of thyme in it too. This method works best with a less is more approach. At its core, the salted heavy cream, pepper and nutmeg alone will be delicious. I don\u2019t even butter the dish, the moisture & fat in the cream and the butter on top prevent sticking. It\u2019s a one dish prep (except to mix the salt and spices in the cream\u2014which you don\u2019t even need to do, you could also do that in the baking dish. Don\u2019t overfill the baking dish, I use an oval Corningware dish and it\u2019s about half way filled with potatoes. The \u201csauce\u201d is really just a heavy cream reduction and the small amount of potato starch released from the potatoes. If you overbake it, the potatoes will soak up the cream and it will be dry. You want it to look a little liquid-y when you take it out of the oven. Don\u2019t skip the water rinsing step, it prevents the potatoes from sticking together and being glue-y.",
      "To save time, I\u2019ll parboil the potatoes to slightly less than fully cooked ahead of time, and I pour the sauce in warm to finger hot, not boiling. Then I bake it until the sauce bubbles and the potatoes are done as tested with a fork. Usually just 15 minutes. Using a larger container and making it shallow/short also speeds things up. Speed makes it easier when you have to time and coordinate multiple dishes like for holiday dinners. Otherwise, I\u2019ve learned through experience that you have to bake it for an incredibly long time. That\u2019s great if your schedule allows, and especially if you\u2019re able to make them ahead, since they reheat really well.",
      "I like Sohla el-Waylly's recipe on seriouseats a lot. It has you mandoline the potatoes directly into the cream mixture to prevent oxidation and keep all the starch in, I don't know if it makes a huge difference but it's pretty easy and it's always been delicious.",
      "You're likely right about the velvety texture\u2014restaurants often use a small amount of **gelatin (0.5\u20131%)** or **reduced chicken stock (glace de volaille)** to enrich cream sauces without making them heavy. This adds body and mouthfeel. Your mum\u2019s trick with the crushed stock cube works well, but for deeper flavor, try incorporating high-quality reduced stock instead. Use **heavy cream (36\u201340% fat)** and reduce it gently to concentrate richness. Finish with a touch of acid (lemon juice or white wine vinegar) to balance the fat. If you're noticing a difference due to local ingredients, focus on **cream quality** and **poultry type**\u2014both significantly affect flavor. Lastly, for that restaurant-level finish, try letting the sauce rest briefly before serving to allow it to set slightly and develop a smooth, glossy texture. Let me know your current method\u2014happy to help you troubleshoot further.",
      "My recipe is from a Joy of Cooking edition from the \u201870s. I slice the potatoes paper thin, and parboil them (I infuse the water with a lot of garlic first), just very briefly. I think it\u2019s like 3 minutes, they\u2019re so thin and you only want them half cooked. Then, in a well-buttered glass baking dish, I lay down a layer of potatoes. Then I sprinkle the top of the layer with seasoning, flour, grated cheese, and dot it all over with butter. Then repeat the layers until your dish is full. End with cheese. Then pour whole milk over it, you want the half cooked milk to fill the dish about 3/4 of the way. Bake at 350 until done. The potatoes will be tender, and it will have created a bechamel. I frequently add things to the layers. Asparagus, wilted spinach, peas, ham, shrimp\u2026 actually, romaine lettuce is surprisingly tasty in this. You can also make it the same way, but dispense with the flour and butter, and use heavy cream (at least 40%) instead of milk. The cream thickens up nicely, and it\u2019s more decadent."

It's summer here but I'm cooking it soon anyway. When I was a kid, my mum used to make \"splodge\" which my dad and I loved especially. It wasn't a soup, it was cooked rice with a bechamel like lemon sauce and cooked chicken folded through it. My dad passed away this year and I miss him greatly but when I play a song that reminds me of him or cook something I know he would've loved it makes him feel a little less far away. As someone who adores rice in soup, I feel like your recipe has brought 2 of my favourite things together in a way I hadn't dreamed of. I'm not sure you'll ever read this, but if you do, thank you. It's 3am, this singular tear sitting on my cheek is a happy one filled with thanks to you for your kindness and a happy family memory unlocked. I will cook your recipes and think of my dad, but also you and your kindness. Wishing you all the best from me here in New Zealand \u2764\ufe0f",
      "No words will be adequate but Terry I wish for you the most amazing and pleasant and love filled days to come. Thank you for sharing your recipes and may your generosity be returned to you a thousand-fold or more. My heart goes out to you and your friends and family and loved ones.",
      "Just wanted to say I'm currently cooking up a batch of your Pozole. I've never heard of it before, much less cooked it, but the recipe looked pretty simple and it sounded pretty good for a cold day like today. It took a bit of running around to find the hominy up here in the Great White North, but luckily there's a neat little Latin grocery store close by carries it. OP, I hope you're doing as well as you can be considering the circumstances. Just one of your recipes has already introduced me to some new ingredients that I'm excited to explore more. I know it's small and it doesn't mean much, but you've already made a positive impact on this internet stranger, so for that, I thank you."

      "This reminds me of the first time I made Lasagna. This was before internet and I was a teenager. I was working with a poorly translated recipe from a magazine in South Asia. The recipe called for 2 tablespoons of red chili powder for the meat sauce. That would be paprika I know now. I only knew of our red chili powder. I used 2 tablespoons of our Indian red chili powder and I kept that up for many more tries to come. It was the first ever \u201cItalian\u201d recipe for my family and friends, made for fancy occasions only because of how difficult it was to procure the cheese. Everyone ate it with gusto, wiping tears pouring down their face, and commenting on how strangely the heat of the chili complimented the \u201ccoolness\u201d of cheese in the dish and that Italians were oh so intelligent for that. Edit: Thank you for the awards lovely people. I would\u2019ve never known that my utter ignorance and my family\u2019s cuteness would earn me my first Reditt awards. I am very grateful. Edit 2: I am so happy that this story has made the day for so many of you. To clarify, I understand all of you who are saying that a proper lasagne recipe wouldn\u2019t have paprika in it. This was before internet, in a small town in South Asia, where a person who likely didn\u2019t have culinary training was translating a recipe from English for a small magazine in our local language. I am quite sure they wanted us to make a red meat sauce since tomato paste wasn\u2019t an option. So they probably meant me to add red kashmiri mirch powder. I now know that I was supposed to write lasagne, not lasagna. I also now kind of know, the flavor difference between Indian red chili powder, chili powder, chili blend, paprika, smoked paprika etc. I haven\u2019t lived in the US, but because of internet and more access to foreign ingredients many things are clearer now. We are all always learning :) My family and friends are really really cute as are you all who are being so kind and forgiving and teaching us about this.",

He was the reason I became curious about food and broke out of my safety bubble of bland basics. I found myself not just wanting to try these foods, but to learn to cook them. And through those passions, I've met some of the best people in my life. But it wasn't just my safe food bubble that he burst. I also became more aware of the world, of other peoples and what their lives were like in the day to day. I honestly think I became a better person because of Bourdain. I certainly can't imagine who I would be if I hadn't come across his works. As I saw someone else say on twitter earlier, I'll shall celebrate Anthony \"by skipping brunch, trying a new dish and telling off a dictator.\"",

I admired him so much and always told people that he gets to live the greatest life I could think of: traveling the world on CNN\u2019s dime, eating at some of the greatest restaurants in the world, eating at some of the greatest hole in the walls in the world, drinking the finest wines with Chinese businessmen.....just getting to see and experience so much all over the world.

I always found his demeanor to be genuine and calming. Thats why I always turned to his shows when I was going through a rough patch in my life. He always gave me a wider perspective when I was trapped in my own world depressed about this or that. I'll forever be thankful to him for the days and nights that he helped me get through. I feel that what we saw on TV was who he really was and thats a great person. Whatever led him to this decison I just wished he could have reached out for help because im sure there would have been a line around the block wanting to help him, i know i would have it. I hope that your pain is gone now Mr.Bourdain and your soul is at peace. I pray that your family and loved ones get all the help they need to get through this.

The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire\u2019s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It\u2019s not desiring the fall; it\u2019s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling \u2018Don\u2019t!\u2019 and \u2018Hang on!\u2019, can understand the jump.

Many celebrities that I've cared about, I care more for the characters/roles than the person themselves (not to say I don't care about the people, but it's just in the nature of their work). But Anthony Bourdain's body of work really is *him*. It's much more personal. It's so sad to see him pass and even sadder to know he was feeling this way. This along with Kate Spade's death really shows how depression can affect anyone no matter the age, wealth or level of success. I hope that if any good can come out of this, it will be to legitimize the feelings of people who are depressed or suffering similarly and to bring attention and awareness to how pervasive such struggles are. Of course my condolences go out to his friends and family and anyone who looked to him as a role model."

Beans are just filler.\" \"Maybe, but damn, black beans round out a chili in a nice way.\" \"No, you're just wussing out. Chili is about the *meat*.\" \"You're wrong about that - meat is just filler, too.\" \"What? That's stupid. It's a meat dish.\" \"Naw man, your recipe is *chili con carne.* Chili, *with* meat. Chili is about *the peppers.* That's where the flavour and fundamental experience of chili comes from. Chili without meat is still chili - it's just not chili *con carne.* Meat is just as much a \"filler\" as beans are. So long as you start with good peppers you're gonna be fine. See, I got mainly a base of poblanos here for their flavour, but I like to use some habaneros to give it a little extra heat. Say, what kind of peppers did *you* use? Chili powder man. What? *Chili powder?* As the *foundation* of your chili? Some rusty old dust from the back of your pantry that doesn't even taste like chili? No fresh peppers at all? Dude, that's *not* chili. ---------- (Not an earnestly held opinion, I was just taking the piss - but I still remember the confused look the meathead got.)",

I believed she would complain the next day if she thought there was any issue or found a single bean. Several other fast food places had banned her for being a pain and I hope to god that that Wendy's eventually did the same. I can't count the amount of times I wanted to tell her to piss off and make her own god damn cup of chili.",

Sometimes when I can't find the will to even make a sandwich I just wat veggies and it's a great healthy alternative to just not eating or having junk. Eggs are cooking, but frying one is super easy and takes about 5 min. Add cheese and it's yummy. Add veggies and it's healthy. Add to ramen for protein. For the very unmotivated, you can wipe out the (nonstick) pan with a paper towel and leave it on the stove as your egg pan for a few meals. Canned beans. Open and rinse. Done. Add to microwaved rice (minute rice or buy frozen. Encourage brown.) Any veggie can be added. Great with a lot of salad dressings, tomato sauce for the non traditional, sour cream. Fruit with peanut butter. I like bananas best but apples are good too.",

      "My true magic in the kitchen as a young student, than mother, was always making something wonderful outta nothing. I keep bags of bones and vegetable pieces in my freezer for ready broth. I never throw away my bacon fat or any fat for that matter. I save chicken fat or beef fat skimmed from cold broths, all labeled in my freezer. I save bags of frozen uneaten precut fruit no one will eat in time. I learned to keep everything and anything that can be saved and use it to make my meals even better! As my kids have all moved out I have started to dabble in better ingredients way more than ever before. I also notice only cooking for two has given me the time I needed to focus more on different techniques and the science of cooking. However, I still rely on my days of making something outta nothing. Those days really taught me a depth about cooking I never would have achieved by always having the best ingredients. Happy cooking and creating!",
      "When I was nearing the end of college, there was a homeless gentleman that would hang out behind my apartment building during the day. A few times I cooked dinner for the two of us. We\u2019d sit outside on the park bench and eat together. He critiqued my cooking and the quality of the ingredients I used like no one else. I\u2019ll never forget the first meal I made us- chicken piccata. The first thing he told me was that the chicken breasts were a bit gamy and could be better, and the capers were too large. Never complained about the drinks, though! He moved on when the temporary shelter nearby closed. No matter his critiques, he always said my cooking was better than the food he got there. I\u2019ve become a much better cook since then, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s part of the reason I enjoy cooking for others. Thank you for the company, Robert! I hope you\u2019re doing well!!",
      "There\u2019s an old saying in Sweden (probably not a great cuisine to use as an example) that goes \u201cman tager vad man haver\u201d - roughly translated meaning: you cook with what you have. I agree that you can achieve great results with expensive and hard to source ingredients. But sometimes it\u2019s not possible for financial, seasonal or geographical reasons. Turning ingredients into a good meal is what makes you a good cook! And enjoying a meal with good people is the only thing that matters",
      "Couldn't agree more! I've been a professional chef for years and while there are foods that vary in quality and thus price, everyone has a budget and has to live within that, just think how many of us are on furlough currently and have had to adapt to a reduced income and make budget cuts accordingly. One of my lockdown projects over the last year was to fonally get my YouTube channel up and running after years of wanting to get started but never having the luxury of time. Most of my supplies are aqquired from those well known German budget supermarkets, a combination of limited budget and also breaking the stigmatism that they sell crap, generally most lines are of equal and in some cases better quality, it's a bit like clothing, a lot of the times you are paying for a label. I often hear people argue that the fresh produce doesn't last as long, that's generally because those types of suppliers don't use chemicals to keep the produce looking its best. There's no shame in buying to your budget, sure I splash out on a decent cut of meat or something from time to time but generally I stick to a tight budget, having the ability to cook from scratch also makes that budget stretch a little futher. I've even worked for quite a few restaurants over the years that utilise the proce point of budget supermarkets to aqquire a lot of their supplies because they believe the quality is that good! I wonder how a food snob guest in a restaurant would feel if they knew that their meal was sourced at low prices. Buying organic / from source etc is great if you can afford it but for those that cant, there's no need to feel shame about where your goods come from.",
      "The same goes for cooking equipment, too. Every time someone posts a thread on this sub asking for advice on equipment, the thread is full of recommendations of All-Clad, Le Crueset, knives that cost $150 and up, and other high-end things. And yeah, it's really nice to have high-quality equipment, but not everyone can (or wants to) pay hundreds of dollars for a single piece of cookware. Not to mention, a lot of stuff can be hard to find outside of specialty stores. That doesn't mean they can't make good food, and the gatekeep-y attitude I see around gear sometimes really bugs me as a person who, not very long ago, saw buying anything at higher than Target/Walmart level an extravagance. For that matter, I also see a lot of judgement about electric stoves/ovens; are gas an induction better? You bet they are, but tons of people rent and have to deal with the cheap electric equipment their landlord installed. No matter what someone's budget is, they can make a good meal, and we need to be encouraging of that. Edit: And I guess I should have stated it more clearly, but part of that means maybe making an effort to recommend quality lower-cost stuff before immediately jumping to things that would strain an average person's budget."

When I got home, I expected to smell delicious slow cooked dinner. Only to smell nothing. The kitchen was looking pretty nice, though. Turns out my room mate decided to deep clean the kitchen, which was really nice of him. But in order to wipe down the part where the crock pot was, he decided to unplug it, move it for a second, then plug it back in... which he completely forgot to do.

      "I almost had an aneurysm dealing with both my parents one evening. We were having family over at their place and my mom asked me to come by 10-15 minutes early \"to help with a couple things.\" I know my mom, and if she's being coy or asking for a little favor, it's normally something she doesn't understand or can pull off; so I go over 30 minutes early. Turns out she wanted me to chicken alfredo for 12-15 family members. Not a problem in itself, alfredo is super easy and quick. But this woman has nowhere near the correct amount or proportion of ingredients. She has like 1 cup of heavy cream and enough Parmesan to kill a god. And NO FUCKING CHICKEN. I send her to the store to get a couple pints of creme, lemon, a few baguettes, and THE FUCKING CHICKEN. I tell my dad to start his gas grill for the chicken. He argues charcoal would be better. I agree, it would, but we don't have time for that. He doubles down, and I have to bring up that every time he's in charge of cooking we eat 90 minutes late. Fucking start the grill. He finally relents. I've been there for 10 minutes I already am about to pull my hair out with them. My mother returns with the correct ingredients (this was actually a surprise). Family starts to arrive. Now my mother desperately wants to give our family the impression that we lovingly cook together all the time and we're a well-oiled machine where the opposite is true. All current and former chefs know this frustration. She has no sense of space, does not clean as she cooks, and has a small kitchen. I normally ask her to run food to distract her, but she's not having that today. She's determined to show how she \"helps.\" Her range is super under-powered. I have put it on max and find her heaviest pan just so I can get enough heat in the pan to warm this mass of creme. I have it on for maybe a minute and she goes over and loudly says, \"You have the heat up too high! Let me help you with that!\" Fucking turns it down. I explain to everybody why I did that, and told her politely but sternly, \"Please do not do that.\" My dad enters with the cooked chicken about 15 minutes later. I set up a cutting board at the end of the kitchen area and I start slicing it. My mom want to help so I show her the cuts I want: thin, even, and across the grain. She fucking butchers it. My dad wanders into the kitchen, and what does he do? \"You have the pan on too hot!\" Fucking turns it down. I am visibly frustrated at this point and my Aunts and Uncles can see it. They are starting to laugh because my parents are being comically stupid. Thank God for my dad's cousin Eve.

      "TL;DR my Dad's wife ruined an entire Christmas meal by \"warming it up in the oven\" at 475 for 20 minutes after it was already fully cooked and still hot. I will never forgive my dad's wife for this. We'd planned on a turkey dinner for Christmas which I made from scratch. 5 years prior I'd taught myself to cook for Christmas and had made a full turkey dinner every Christmas since. Every year since the start of the tradition I'd eaten alone or with a few close friends because my family stood me up without a word. I'd eat turkey every meal for a week afterwards because I had bought enough food for everyone and they never came. That year I'd gotten firm commitments from everyone well in advance. I told them I'd cook it at my place and bring it over so they didn't have to deal with the mess or have to come to me all of 20 minutes away so I could finally share this meal with my family on Christmas. I brought my A game. Wet brined it for 3 days put a custom blend of spices and butter under the skin then added a dry rub the night before so it had time to soak in before cooking. I even wove two types of bacon together and wrapped the whole thing. I'm a great cook and this is my best meal every year. Researched it for weeks must have watched hundreds of videos and read a stupid amount about each dish worked really hard to make sure that it was perfect. Time had been set for weeks in advance because my girlfriend now fiance and mother of my children couldn't get out of work till then. Dad's wife tried to change the time the moment I put the turkey in the oven and told them it was cooking. She was going to call off the whole thing if it didn't happen 1-2 hours earlier because \"her brothers were coming in and they don't want to wait.\" Started saying that my girlfriend would just have to be alone for Christmas and we'd eat without her and find her own ride home. Which was ultimately bullshit anyway they didn't know what I was talking about when I mentioned it to her brothers and she feigned ignorance even though I had it in text but that's a whole other thing. The compromise I made before I found out was to let the turkey rest at their house instead of waiting till it was ready and picking her up on the way so they could start eating a bit sooner. It's not like it just magically takes less time to cook because you want it to so it was the best I could do. Explained to everyone not to touch the turkey till I got back with the girlfriend but they could snack on the sides while they wait I'd even made appetizers to hold them over it wasn't far anyway. She decided everything sides included needed to go into the oven at 475 for 20 minutes while I was gone to warm it up. She'd just taken it out when we got back. She also decided to cut 3-4 holes in the turkey to make sure it was done prior to that so all the juices drained out and it burned the whole thing. The mashed potatoes were liquid the stuffing was crispy everything was overcooked the two types of bacon turned black it was super dry. My dad's wife talked the whole meal about how dry it was and over cooked and that I'd need to keep working on my recipe like it wasn't her fault. I just about lost it but I choked back my dry turkey and tried to enjoy Christmas anyway and kept my mouth shut till I got home. When we got home my girlfriend said that she expected so much more from the turkey after seeing the process going in and me talking about it for weeks. I couldn't contain it any longer. She straight ruined my Christmas meal! If the wall of text doesn't clue you in it still pisses me off years later I will never forget it. Why in god's name would you \"warm something up\" at nearly 500 degrees let alone for 20 minutes!",

I'm a 1st gen Chinese-American and nowhere near that guy in that video, but I'm definitely guilty of ripping on some Americanized dishes. For me it's an attempt to distance the stereotype of Chinese food being dirty and just 3am drunk food (which don't get me wrong it does a fantastic job of). I grew up in a very predominately white area of the US and all my friends thought Chinese food was weird since all they knew of it were late night takeout spots with low health scores or the \"strange\" smelling tofu my mom would pack me for lunch. After moving to a more diverse city I got comfortable with owning my culture rather than shying away and thinking it was weird. I can see how my attempt to convince people that there's more to Chinese food than Americanized Chinese food can sometimes come off elitist though (like going on a rant when my friend orders crab rangoon at an authentic Chinese restaurant, akin to someone ranting on well done steaks at a steakhouse, or a bagel snob explaining that the \"tap water is different in NYC\" when we should just let people enjoy what they want). Nonetheless I'm happy to see that foods like dim sum & soup dumplings are trendy now and eating new foods is viewed as being cultured rather than just weird/dirty. It's a hell of a lot easier to convince friends/coworkers to give it a shot than it was growing up I'm proud to say through a lot of effort of pushing my friends to give authentic Chinese food a chance I've convinced some of my more sheltered friends to try and LOVE mapo tofu to the point when I'm in town they'll suggest \"want to go numb our face for dinner?\". Also gotta say I really like how /u/Distasteful_Username compared it to Tex-mex, you hit the nail on the head. I'm definitely gonna use that in the future!",

Their versions of shabu shabu, pho, and the fried rice dishes and ESPECIALLY [wollamsam](https://image.shutterstock.com/image-photo/fresh-vegetables-delicious-meat-rice-260nw-572513500.jpg) (which is the Koreanized version of [g\u1ecfi cu\u1ed1n](https://banhtrangnhubinh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/goi-cuon-6-420x280_c.jpg) I believe - one of the biggest differences is that for wollamsam you assemble it yourself so you can choose all the ingredients, sauces, etc. and the process is the best part imo). Now that I live in Romania I basically won't ever have wollamsam again unless I somehow source all the ingredients and spend several days making it myself (because there are pickled radishes, fancy sauces, etc.)...because even when I go to Vietnamese restaurants, or when I did back in the States, they were delicious but not the same. :((( The good news is there's an excellent Korean restaurant here so I can get a lot of traditional Korean foods whenever I want, which is a relief at least. :D",
      "It\u2019s the same with Indian food in the UK - it\u2019s a wonderful beast of it\u2019s own! When my American friends ask me what food I recommend when they travel to the UK, I always suggest they check out an Indian restaurant here and it really confuses them! british Indian food is amazing and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve read that a lot of the dishes we refer to as Indian just don\u2019t exist in India at all. British-Indians developed the food here with what they could get. I saw a video on two people living in Korea ordering Chinese takeout and how different it was to takeaway I could get here! I\u2019m so curious the differences for each country. I quite like our Chinese food here and all it does is get me excited to try the origins before the food was adapted to each country for preference or ingredients, cushion and new creations. Though I\u2019d be surprised if there was English-take away and what even that would be ?! Just fish n chips? Pies? Honestly curious",
      "Authenticity often gets in the way of food getting better. It's a weird quality that is praised by foodie culture but stifles innovation. David Chang talked about this in relation to both Chinese food and Pizza I believe. Take your classic margherita pizza praised for it's authenticity, never changing, never evolving, and while people who love authenticity love it it's something that the average consumer of pizza couldn't care less about. America has hundreds if not thousands of kinds of pizza. Japan has pizza with seafood that is nothing like traditional pizza or American pizza, and that innovation is beautiful. Authenticity is great right up until it inhibits growth or acts as snobby food gatekeeping.",

I hate when people comment on food in general (although of course you want to know if something is poisonous and make sure you overall have a healthy diet, etc.) Why has something meant to nourish us and be enjoyed turned into a competition? >.< I love to learn the origins behind food but if I don\u2019t want to eat it, I won\u2019t, and if I do want to eat it, I will, without feeling the need to tell everyone \u201cOH, I TRIED X AUTHENTIC FOOD LOOK AT HOW CULTURED I AM.\u201d When I go for Mexican or Chinese, it is because my stomach craves a particular dish that day and it\u2019s something the other restaurant can\u2019t make since it\u2019s not what they specialize in. What I care about most is how much love the chef put behind the food and of course I want their culture to overall be honored through their cooking, but people frustrate me with their need for trophies. I hope this makes sense and doesn\u2019t sound offensive. I don\u2019t know if I worded it properly and my point got across but basically I\u2019m tired of bashing and trophy culture as well.

      "So sorry this happened to you and your family . Growing up in Texas, where our food has a lot of Mexican influence, we mainly cook pinto beans. The southern style is slightly different, as the Mexican version (beans a la charro) tend to be spicy, but they are both made at home and at tons of restaurants here. There\u2019s even a spice blend here called \u201cpinto beans seasoning\u201d that I was baffled I couldn\u2019t find when my family moved to the Bay Area. Lol. I would stock up on it when we went back home for a visit. At any rate, since it such a common thing to cook here, and always from dried, as canned beans are considered the inferior way to go; I\u2019ve always known that beans need to be (preferably) soaked overnight and cooked for hours. Most people here know how to cook beans, for that reason, even if they sometimes take the shortcut and use canned. A traditional meal here is to cook a large pot of pinto beans with those lovely spices and serve it with cornbread; although my Mom\u2019s are somehow the best I\u2019ve ever had and she only adds butter, onion and garlic powder. You soak them overnight and throw away the soaking liquid (which reduces the chance for the beans to cause gas). You bring them to a rolling boil for 10-15 minutes, then reduce to a simmer for another 2-3 hours. Cooking them low and slow (after the initial 10-15 minutes boiling), ensures they will get tender but not mushy and also helps the beans to attain a wonderfully flavorful, thick broth. A pot of beans simmering on the stove for hours means a delicious meal is in store, with the cook sampling the broth toward the end and getting advice on what to add, similar to when one might be making a good pasta sauce. We serve pinto beans with homemade cornbread, and the beans taste even better the next day, as the broth will be even richer.",

I've been cooking beans for years with varying results, including a few batches that never got soft enough to be edible even after 8+ hours, and I could never figure out why, even after researching. I think those variations will stop soon after I make some adjustments based on what I've learned here. I hope you and your family have a much better remainder of 2022 -",

      "\u201cDid you know that eating raw kidney beans can be toxic? According to the FDA, eating as few as 4-5 uncooked kidney beans can cause severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea in 1-3 hours after ingestion. Uncooked kidney beans have an unusually high concentration of a chemical called phytohaemagglutinin that is destroyed when the beans are properly cooked by boiling. Apparently, cooking in a slow cooker may actually make the beans more dangerous because low temperature cooking increases the toxicity.\u201d https://blogs.extension.iastate.edu/answerline/2013/06/03/eating-raw-kidney-beans-can-be-toxic/",

Now you're listening to them all be sick and you seem to be mad about it...mad at the people you made sick I mean, and the food you made them sick with...but no blame for yourself, whose entire fault it is. And btw it sounds like she bought Rancho Gordo beans. I guess you aren't much of a cook, but every food has it's higher quality version and beans are no exception.

Came back a few minutes later to the glass bottom + cake bottom scorched and freaked out. I decided to move the collander out of the sink and get the cake pan in there so as not to damage the counter. Went to explain and apologize to my roommate. She was more disappointed than mad, and we laughed about it. Disaster averted, we smoked some more. Maybe 5-10 minutes later I remember my eggies and that they needed an ice bath.

      "Swerve. Switched to Keto a while back and had a tough time finding good BBQ sauce that wasn't loaded with sugar so I started making my own. I love spicy foods and especially like a little heat in my sauce. I also like it with a bit of sweetness like good ol Sweet Baby Rays. So I added Louisiana Supreme hot sauce to my base sauce and Swerve (erythritol) for the sweetener. It is absolutely incredible and a favorite among friends and family because you get that instant heat followed by a slight sweetness that actually cools and quickly provides relief from the spice. If the heat lingers, a sip of water increases the cooling effect of the erythritol. It's definitely unique and I've had a few people ask me to start bottling it.. maybe some day. Edit: Recipe for base sauce, just whisk together all of the following: 1 cup reduced sugar ketchup (I prefer homemade, lots of sugar free recipes) 2 tablespoon Louisiana Hot Sauce (I typically do about 6 tbsp, but start small and adjust, you can add more if desired) 3 teaspoon yellow mustard 3 teaspoon liquid smoke 2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 4 teaspoon garlic salt 2 teaspoon onion powder 2 teaspoon chili powder 4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (add more for more heat) 1-2 teaspoon cumin (careful not to overdo cumin, it will overwhelm the flavor) Swerve to taste (powdered, not granular)",

      "For Pakistan. You should try either Plau or Briyani. Both are rice dishes with either meat, veggies, or legumes (like chickpeas). Biggest downside is it requires many spices you probably don\u2019t have at hand. Like Star Anise. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t have that. But you need it for Plau. Honestly my favorite is chicken briyani and goat plau. They are in my opinion the best versions of each dish. You could go to an Indian store and buy the Shan masala packets to help with the lack of certain spices and they give you directions on the back. But they will never be as good as making the spices yourself. I personally never buy Shan for these dishes. I do for a few other. Btw if your wondering what these dishes are. Plau is rice dish that is cooked in the broth of meat, vegetable, or legume. The way the broth mixes with the rice is just fantastic. (Btw if you want a more regional version of this dish, also make a dish called Zarda it\u2019s a sweet rice dish, and when you eat the dishes, have like 75% plau, 25% zarda. Also this is a risky dish to make. The saltiness is important an aspect to this dish, a lot of people also cook chicken salan with it to counter if it becomes too salty, if you do this I\u2019d say make your plate: 60% plau, 15% zarda, and 25% chicken salan with like a dollop or two of plain yogurt). Briyani is this dish that requires you to fry the meat/veggie/legume (legumes are really not used in this dish) in with its other content apart from the rice, you also cook the rice on the side, and then layer it as rice-fried content-rice-saffron water, and then bake this. (To be honest this dish is best with cucumber raitah, which the one I make is sour cream, ground cucumber, sugar, and cilantro, it\u2019s great in the side of the dish). If you want the recipes for everything I just said with how I make it, just DM me. My directions may be a bit confusing, but I\u2019ll try to fix it up a bit. Like in my recipe book, I use the term star spice instead of star anise. And gharam masala is a spice mix you\u2019ll need to buy. Edit: I should say. These dishes are not just Pakistani. Depending on the method these dishes are made, they are made throughout Southeast Europe to South Asia. For example the plau is called Pilaf in Armenia.",
      "From mexico - Mole Enchiladas Idk what kind of sauce they use for Taco Bell enchiladas but those ain't it chief. Here's a [good recipe](https://www.mexicoinmykitchen.com/chicken-mole-enchiladas/#wprm-recipe-container-2650) and if you can't find mole sauce or mole powder, here's a good enough [version from scratch](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/223261/authentic-mole-sauce/) (you can replace the chicken broth for just plain water and the lard for any other vegetable based lard alternative to make it vegan) and instead of dark chocolate use [\"Abuelita Chocolate\"](https://www.chocolateabuelita.com/assets/img/how-to-prepare-traditional.jpg) does not have to be that brand but the chocolate you use needs to look like that for more authenticity, add 1 triangle piece at a time until its good enough for you (the chocolate counters the heat/spiciness so use as much as you deem necessary, just not too much; they are called enchiladas because \"enchilarse\" refers to the little pain you get from spiciness). You can use vegetable fillings or tofu to make it completely vegan, since my sis is vegan our mother adapted it so she can eat them too. It's not in the recipe listed but you can also roll them instead of just folding them to accommodate more in 1 plate, roll them like you would a piece of paper, not like a burrito. You can also top them with crema or mayo. Oh and do try to get a hold of some crumbling non melting cheese. If you use melting cheese they become [swiss enchiladas](https://www.mexicoinmykitchen.com/swiss-green-enchiladas/) (although the swiss variant is more commonly with green salsa enchiladas). You can accompany with Coke (trust me, its a heavy dish for the gut so it kinda helps with digestion although this is more so personal experience). Or even better with [agua de Jamaica](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/agua_de_jamaica_hibiscus_tea/) (just as good if not better to help with digestion). For dessert - Digestive Biscuit Lime Pie [Follow this recipe](https://us.kiwilimon.com/recipe/desserts/lemon-pie-with-maria-cookies), it's legitimately the easiest dessert even a toddler (with adult supervision) can do. If you cannot find that specific brand you can substitute with any kind of digestive biscuit. &#x200B; Bonus recipes i barely see suggested on reddit: [Pambazo](https://www.mexicoinmykitchen.com/pambazo-mexicano-sandwich/) [Sopa de verdura](https://www.mexicoinmykitchen.com/mexican-squash-with-cheese/) (in this case calabaza which is a cousin to the zucchini which you can substitute if unavailable) [Caldo de Camar\u00f3n](https://www.mexicoinmykitchen.com/mexican-shrimp-soup/) [Pozole Rojo](https://www.mexicoinmykitchen.com/red-pozole-rojo/) (you can use chicken too, this is mostly made in september when independence day comes around \\[15-16 of september\\]) [Chicken Tinga](https://www.mexicoinmykitchen.com/chicken-tinga-recipe/) (can also be made with pork, also made for the september celebrations) [Sopes](https://www.mexicoinmykitchen.com/sopes-recipe/) (kinda a street food and kinda home restaurant food (fonda/comida econ\u00f3mica) [Mexican Salted Cod](https://www.mexicoinmykitchen.com/mexican-style-salted-cod/) (also known as Bacalao, it's more popular as a side dish mainly prepared for Christmas dinner and New Years dinner) &#x200B; Those are off the top of my head, fun fact, i've eaten and helped my mom prepare all of these dishes in the past three weeks (except for the Cod, that one's for December). Extra Bonus: my Abuelita makes a legitimately painful salsa, probably just as bad if not worse than eating ghost peppers. It's so spicy only my dad and i eat it, and in all of our family we are the ones who always add really spicy sauces and salsas on almost anything non sweet yet it's still hard to eat for us but we still do because its kinda super tasty. Literally just add 40 serrano chiles (yes, forty), half an onion, 2 cloves of garlic, salt and a tiny splash of water into a blender and blend it until the chunky green devils paste comes out. It's good on all kinds of tacos, the pambazo, sopes and anything that could benefit from adding salsa. Although i'm not kidding, it legit hurts my stomach if i eat more than 1 tablespoon of it a day. Make it for someone willing to eat it. You can half all the amounts since doing it with the 40 serranos makes about 8 to 10 oz.",
      "Already done feijoada? I'm guessing you're American - in my experience the biggest challenges is just finding (affordable) sources for (fresh) foreign ingredients so your recipe isn't all substitutions. Most cities have local shops that source them, but they may not be running ads on Google Maps. French and Italian are go-to cuisines to learn for good reason but if you liked Latin American, you might be more inclined to Southeast Asian cuisine. Vietnamese bun cha and banh mi (really recommend including a pate at minimum - it's missing a lot of the original flavors if you use just a regular piece of grilled meat) stand out. Thai khao soi beef is incredible if done right (and difficult to find outside of north Thailand) and krapao moo (minced pork with holy basil - served with white rice and a fried egg on top) is pretty much the perfect daily comfort food. I'd add tom yum goong but truthfully it's difficult to find the ingredients in the US and it just doesn't taste the same with concentrates or powders.

      "Suggestion You don't need hello fresh. Yeah, it's good if you have no confidence in the kitchen but it's a set of training wheels. When you go off the book is when you really learn. Read recipes and watch videos of cooks (Adam ragusea is good but don't go for his sponsors he doesn't research his sponsors well Then there is binging with babish who also doesn't research his sponsors and then the almighty chef John and J. Kenji Lopez alt.) J. Kenji, binging with babish and chef John is recommended. They frequently borrow from each other (j Kenji exception they mostly borrow from him) and give you great techniques for good recipes. Their grilled cheese technique is a game-changer and ever since then I've loved making grilled cheese as a standalone snack. Adam ragusea is good to cut down on your work. He doesn't always have the best recipes but he does cut down on unnecessary work but his recipes aren't usually perfect they do need tweaking and upgrading but they act as a good base. If I needed to recommend some good kitchen gear to invest in it would be a good knife. Victorinox fibrox and Wusthof have good budget knives that are good quality and last well. W\u00fcsthof is best but fibrox works. If you get a cheap knife (no judging) you'll also need to invest in a knife sharpener as cheap knives use soft metals that lose their edge fast but knife sharpeners destroy better knives made of more brittle but harder metal (such as high-quality carbon steel) And a black pepper grinder. A cole and mask capstan or Peugeot u select are go-to's but the unicorn magnum is the gold standard but not necessary. Fresh pepper is a very common ingredient and it tastes so much better fresh. You'll never get the same taste boxed. But boxed white pepper is fine no use in freshly grinding white pepper as it's just spice. The flavor exists in the outer black portion. Also, a good saucepan is great and versatile. Steak? Quick tomato sauce? Blooming cocoa powder for cakes? Pasta? Omelets? Toasting sandwiches? You get the point. I'd suggest getting a steel pan instead of a nonstick because fond is very good for steaks and non-stick is kinda a pain because of oven safety and cleaning it carefully and it's fragile in case of scratches and the silicon tools you'll need. Iron clads are best as they offer the conductivity of copper pans and the heat storage of cast iron! Very versatile!",
      "When it comes to veggies, everyone who takes up home cooking seems to go through a certain arc. I'll give you the overview (as I understand it) so you can kind of skip around and mix things up right from the start. :-) Just starting out: Ugh, veggies are so boring. MEAT MEAT MEAT. Look at this NY strip I made! I do like veggies smothered in cheese sauce tho, that totally counts! Novice: Roasting veggies is THE BOMB! I thought I didn't like veggies, but salt oil and heat babyyyyy! Journeyman: You can fry these things in some oil and garlic in a pan or wok. Really good! (Also, you can bread and deep fry these suckers! But you don't do it much b/c deep frying at home is kinda messy. But beer battered green beans dipped in lemon aioli is awesome!) Leveling up: Huh. Once you learn how to pick good veggies, they can be great raw. Composed salads with homemade salad dressing, if you pay attention to every element, don't just throw stuff together, keep it fairly simple, and buy stuff at the farmer's market\u2026lemme just [shred these Brussels sprouts](https://youtu.be/_IutXnfFIgQ). Experience accumulating: Wow, if you're working with great produce you can put these suckers in a steamer, don't overdo it and leave them crisp, and hit them with a sprinkle of salt and maybe a pat of butter and a grind of pepper, and this is a pig out. You feel good after stuffing yourself too. Grandma level: [Boil veggies in a pot](https://youtu.be/21ofoREnXbM), dat's a WAP, dat's a (Water And Pot'o'veg).

Accidental vegetarian: I just realized I made an entire meal that was awesome and didn't have any animal protein. Oops.",
      "I am (honoured to be) routinely complimented on my veg side dishes. I get asked for recipes but I don't have any - chop, toss in a little oil, add some herbs/spices/salt and that's it! I think CARE is the key. Vegetables will always play second fiddle to meat when you put care and attention into the latter and not the former. It doesn't take very much effort to keep an eye on the veg as it roasts... toss it, taste it, season it... try different combinations and add other flavours. Mediterranean roast veg for me means slicing up some peppers, courgettes, aubergine and red onion, tossing it in olive oil, garlic, oregano, salt, pepper, and sprinkling over half a jar of black pitted olives and crumbling over some feta. It's so simple and delicious. Experiment! Going for some east-asian flavours? Switch out the olive oil for some sesame oil, ginger, add a drizzle of honey and some soy sauce, garnish with roasted peanuts... The easiest way to ensure they cook consistently is to look at the size and density of the pieces you're working with. If you're chopping a carrot and a courgette for roasting together, look at the difference in density - chop the carrot pieces half the size of the courgettes. Try different shapes, like batons vs. large chunks. Trial and error and you'll soon learn what works for you!",
      "Not the healthiest suggestion, but when I season I also add a little sugar. Really brings out a nice crisp! Agree with other comments that brussel sprouts are great. Also, roasted red pepper is WAY better in a salad than raw red pepper. Make sure you really char it though - it takes like ten minutes under the broiler to bring out all the sweetness",
      "Raw veggies are kinda the worst. Roasted or grilled...they can be better than whatever your main is. My staples are Broccoli, Bell Peppers (actually good raw, but better grilled), Yams, Onions and lately Grilled Zucchini. For broccoli break them into small florets and toss with olive oil. Sprinkle garlic and salt and then roast them until they start to blacken. They're amazing. &#x200B; Bell Peppers I cut into quarters (after cutting out the middle) and toss with olive oil and kosher salt and put them skin side down on the grill until they get black marks. They're good raw, but wow are they amazing grilled. &#x200B; Yams I peel, and then cut into small cubes (cut off the ends, cut into slices, then cut the slices in to 4 or 6 parts). Toss them in olive oil (a recurring theme) and then season them with Allspice and a little salt. Roast them and you have savory sweet yum yum yams. &#x200B; Onions are good with everything roasted and grilled. Toss with olive oil and roast them with any of the above or slice it and put whole slices on the grill. &#x200B; Zucchini is new for me, but I've been cutting off the ends then slicing them long-wise and with a little....guess what!... olive oil and salt then you pop them on the grill until they get brown marks. I normally hate zucchini, especially raw, but grilled like this is amazing! I'm going through whole zucchini's nightly."

      "A good idea in theory, but that would require cooking oil companies to be honest about the types of oil they put in a bottle, which they often aren't. There's a huge amount of counterfeit oils on the market, particularly for popular ones like olive and avocado oil.",
      "While I'm not against this idea. I cant image there are many scenarios where people are getting close to or at an oil's smoke point. I'm sure I may have honestly done it a hand full of times in my life but can't say it is nessacary to know. Still useful though.",

I imagine vegetable and canola oil don\u2019t either because the smoke points vary based on contents and they really don\u2019t have any market share to gain by doing so. Actually probably the same for EVOO.",
      "not a horrible idea, however people talk about the smoke point as if it is an absolute thing. objective measuring of smoke points is nontrivial, and you can find wide ranges of values across different scientific publications, both because of differences in the oil itself (despite it being from the same plant source), differences in measurement method, as well as differences in the threshold for what is to qualify as the onset of smoking. &#x200B; it is not like how at a given pressure, it is easily determined that water boils at 100C. So it would be difficult to have consistency and meaningful numbers across brands, etc."

A smoke point will either make them think of smoking and cancer or setting their house on fire. People are really that irrational, the first company to do this is probably making a marketing mistake.",

Fried shallots, on the other hand, are heavenly. (2) I experimented with a roast garlic and goat cheese sandwich. It was tasty, but if I were in space, the farts would have propelled me to the moon.",
      "A touch of garlic goes a long way when you prepare it properly. You can drop 50 cloves into a stew, but all the flavorful oils are just going to break down and dissipate by the time the stew is finished. A lot of Mediterranean dishes only use a fraction of the amount of garlic that Americans use, but you can taste the garlic just fine. The official recipe for Genovese pesto (and there really is one official recipe) calls for 1/2 of a clove for 25 grams of basil (about 1.25 cups). But when you pound that half into a paste with some salt, and then pound the basil leaves into it, and then pound the nuts and cheese, you get this amazing creamy garlic-basil sauce with tons of flavor. American-style blender pesto requires three to four times the amount of garlic, and actually gets less flavor. This works with normal American supermarket garlic - it's the only kind I have! - so this isn't because Italian garlic is somehow different. Same with garlic bread - Italians and Spaniards rub the clove on toast, then toss the clove. A lot of Italian casseroles and gratins ask you only to rub a clove on the pan before baking. And yet the aroma of garlic will shine through. Sometimes less is more. Give it a try; you might be surprised.",
      "I'd have to disagree. Garlic is a great ingredient, but there it can be too overpowering. I can understand why if you're a beginer who cooks occasionally, just throwing in lots of garlic is an awesome way of making a dish tastier- I agree. I cook almost every meal of mine- if I allow garlic to dominate in every dish, the food will just taste garlicky and boring. It's more interesting to allow different spices to shine in different recipes. Cumin, fennel, cardamom, ginger, chillies all can be the star of a dish. For me, I decide on a flavour profile I want, and add in the aromatics accordingly. TL;DR: you don't want a extremely garlicky dish all the time since it will get boring soon enough",
      "My husband and his best friend once cooked a Friendsgiving and the mashed potatoes were SO garlicky (according to everyone else, they thought they were fine). However, I don\u2019t think they saut\u00e9ed the garlic first, I think they just tossed a ton of minced raw garlic into cooked mashed potatoes. Otherwise, I agree, I usually put in 2-3x what the recipe calls for when cooking."

I sear them skin side down on high heat for about 3-5 minutes until browned and crisping. Then turn off the burner on one side. Transfer to a foil pan skin side up, (I might throw in some fresh herbs, garlic cloves and/or lemon here), cook with lid closed on the turned off side for about 20 minutes. They come out great every time.",

Depending on how big the thighs are, and how hot your bbq - 15 to 20 (maybe a bit more) mins but use a meat thermometer if you have one to remove guessing. Serve with corn on the cob.

My current favourite is tandoori marinade: greek yogurt, oil, butter, ginger (paste is fine), garlic (paste is fine), chilli powder, coriander, cumin, garam masala, turmeric, black pepper, salt, sugar, lemon juice.

I have[ these metal skewers with 2 prongs](https://a.co/d/4yoWiL2). After drybrine in the fridge, I pull them out, skewer them so they're easy to turn and then let stand for about 30 min before grilling. Start skin side down on med low and let that fat render. Brush with sauce towards the end as the sugars will burn on the grill. I mix up the flavor profiles. Sometimes it's fully dry using Tajin for that citrus punch, sometimes it's just seasoned salt with either Kansas City (sticky/sweet) or South Carolina (yellow/sweet/vinegar) style.

      "Absolutely crucial. Now when shit gets tough, chronic pain flares up, even though I control all my macro and micro variables for what I eat, main thing what I always do and recommend to friends and family members- get fucking lean and drop as much fluff as possoble. And it always works incredibly well. Fix the nutrition and start doing the hard yards- training, whatever that will be. Step by step and build. Then look at sleep and recovery. Optimze that. Stay there. Make uncomfortable feel comfortable because you are doing the right things which will pay dividends down the line. Now this is just a few thoughts while im doing my cardio 1hr15min in already and thinking to do a bit more. Also Elimination works the best because we as humans and society have become nothing else but users and consumers day in and day out. So less is more and i guarantee you, your mental health will be way way better after you ticked all those boxes. Now im not sure perhaps u already there and looking just to level up then there are different things to do but overall this is a great blueprint to get your mental heath up and overall health up. I probably forgot plenty of other important things that add up but hopefully you can get something from this. Best of luck and hang in there. Better days are not far away...if you are willing to do the hard yards. Peace \u270c\ud83c\udffc",
      "There is literal neuronal lining down there, so it's no joke when they say second brain, and all the dietary stuff has to be filtered through a new lens for where mental or psychiatric medicine might not be helping people this might hold answers - and then there's how things are metabolized, but anyway. A curious thing about \"trust your gut\" is that like with hearts synching in bed between couples, the gut does something similar before any chemical thing between people, and doesn't have language like the brain does, so when they say \"trust your gut\" with someone, that really can lie or be lied to - and there are probably diets that can factor in to how clouded or clear that might leave people. It's fascinating stuff, really!",
      "Remember, it's not just food that influences gut health. Lifestyle changes such as exercise and better sleep will have a non-trivial effect, too. It's honestly fascinating\u2014the brain and body go through a great many \"handshakes\" every day without you knowing. For anyone looking to learn more, I recommend \\[this page\\](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection) by Harvard Health, and \\[this article\\](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-86858-3) published by nature.",
      "If you would like a good example of gut impact on mental health, try taking some activated charcoal before bed and monitor the improvements to mental clarity and wellbeing the next day. Small doses of penicillin and distilled white vinegar can promote a similar state",
      "Omg it plays a MAJOR role. It\u2019s like putting diesel in a gasoline car and expecting it to run smoothly. Or at all. What you eat (devour, etc) impacts your gut and that impacts your mental health. Your gut is also affected by sleep, or lack of it, zinc deficiency, vitamin d3 deficiency and more. Dm me if you want more information lol. This is what I specialize in to be honest"

      "I've seen a lot of evidence that it plays a major role. There are studies linking gut health to mental illness and/or recovery from it. There are studies of using gut-based treatments including probiotics and dietary changes to treat depression and other mental health conditions. It's poorly-understood, but the preliminary evidence seems to suggest the effect is potentially large. There are many different potential mechanisms, including: * Poor gut health just leading people to feel bad due to unpleasant symptoms, which is an additional stressor that can worsen mental health * Poor gut health blocking absorption of nutrients, leading to deficiencies that can worsen mental health * Poor gut health resulting in the creation and/or absorption of toxins and/or other harmful compounds which can negatively effect mental health * Good gut health facilitating absorption of nutrients, and even synthesis of those nutrients in the gut * Good gut health (esp. through high fiber intake) resulting in more stable blood sugar which stabilizes mood swings * Gut health modulating the immune system, and infections elsewhere in the body then influencing mental health There may be some more mechanisms I forgot, and there are also likely many mechanisms that haven't even been discovered yet. Also, anecdotally, in my own life, how I eat seems to play a big role in my mental health. Also, the relationship between gut health and mental health is likely bidirectional. Gut health influences mental health, but mental health also influences gut health. Again, there are multiple mechanisms through which this can happen: * Poor mental health elevating stress level which reduces the \"rest and digest\" nervous system, thus harming gut health. * Poor mental health increasing cravings for unhealthy foods, disrupting gut health. * Poor mental health leading to more disordered eating habits, similarly disrupting gut health. * Poor mental health suppressing or weakening the immune system, thus increasing the risk and/or severity of infections in the gut. * Good mental health making people think more rationally about diet and eating, thus improving gut health. * Good mental health making people be more on top of their life so that they have more resources with which to eat healthier. So basically both the gut and the brain are parts of systems that are interconnected in multiple ways, and a healthy state in one helps keep the other in a healthy state too.",

      "> Vitamin deficiencies are extremely uncommon among people in developed countries who eat a reasonably varied diet. This is not necessarily true. Vitamin D deficiency is common and widespread in northern latitudes. Folate deficiency is relatively common. B12 deficiency is common in vegans and some vegetarians. B6 deficiency is common in people with certain conditions, like Celiac disease or people who consume a lot of alcohol. Although scurvy from extreme vitamin C deficiency is rare, levels of Vitamin C consumption far lower than optimal for health are common. Nutrient density matters. If your staples are white rice, things made of refined wheat flour, corn products, iceberg lettuce, grapes, apples, and cherries, and you always eat boneless, skinless meats, you might be deficient in quite a few vitamins. > Why then are people so keen on talking about \u201csuperfoods\u201d and paying money for expensive berries, kale and \u201cshots\u201d? Because nutrient density matters. If your staples are beans and legumes, nuts, seeds, berries, bell peppers, kiwi, citrus, broccoli, skin-on meats, organ meats, or whole meats (such as small fish, shellfish, etc.) you are unlikely to end up with these deficiencies. Yes, \"superfood\" can be a bit of a marketing scam...but...foods are not all equally nutritious. Like take apples and oranges. One typical navel orange has 92% RDA vitamin C, 12% folate, 8% B1, 7% B6, 5% potassium, 5% Calcium, 4% magnesium. Whereas, one typical red delicious apple has negligible vitamin C, no more than 5% of any vitamins: 5% Vitamin K, 4% B6, 4% B2, and 3% B1 and E. It also has 5% potassium, but only 1% calcium, 3% Magnesium And apples aren't the worst food out there, nor are oranges necessarily a superfood. The point I am making is that nutrient density is wildly different in different foods. Some foods are so high in particular nutrients that if you eat even modest amounts, you will get more than enough of those nutrients. Other nutrients don't really help you that much in any way. For example if you eat pumpkin seeds regularly, you probably always have enough magnesium. If you eat parsley regularly (even in small amounts) you probably get enough vitamin K. If you eat any dried shiitake mushrooms, you probably get enough B5 (pantothenic acid). If you eat oranges or bell peppers, you probably get enough vitamin C. If you eat mussels, clams, or oyster, you probably get enough B12, and if you eat oyster you probably get enough Zinc and probably Iron too. If you eat green lentils, you probably get enough folate and probably get enough of most of the B-vitamins. And so on. The little details matter.",
      "Like sure, people who eat a varied diet may not have vitamin deficiency, but the reality is that the average person doesn't eat eat a varied diet and survive off of highly processed food. * [Approximately 35 to 40% of adults in the United States have vitamin D deficiency](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9573946/) * [Around half \\(48%\\) of the US population consumes less than the recommended amount of magnesium from food](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5786912/) * [Specifically**, 94.3% of the US population do not meet the daily requirement for vitamin D, 88.5% for vitamin E, 52.2% for magnesium, 44.1% for calcium, 43.0% for vitamin A, and 38.9% for vitamin C. For the nutrients in which a requirement has not been set, 100% of the population had intakes lower than the AI for potassium, 91.7% for choline, and 66.9% for vitamin K.** The prevalence of inadequacies was low for all of the B vitamins and several minerals, including copper, iron, phosphorus, selenium, sodium, and zinc \\(see Table 1\\). Moreover, more than 97% of the population had excessive intakes of sodium, defined as daily intakes greater than the age-specific UL \\(26\\).](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/micronutrient-inadequacies/overview)",
      "There\u2019s a lot more to phytonutrients than just the vitamins you would know from a multi. There are myriad bioactive compounds in whole foods that are still being heavily researched. Just one example, curcumin isn\u2019t a vitamin or a mineral, but studies have shown turmeric and curcumin supplementation can help with inflammation and joint pain. One more example, sulphuraphane in broccoli, not a vitamin or mineral but it\u2019s major for reducing brain inflammation. I could list literally millions more. Thats not even touching your macros; you\u2019ve got to eat so you might as well eat healthy. But yes, while there is some degree of marketing and hype around things like a\u00e7a\u00ed and g\u1ecdji berries, superfoods do exist.",
      "vitamin deficiencies are incredibly, incredibly common even among people in developed countries who eat a reasonably varied diet. More than 90% of people are deficient in vitamin e, choline, vitamin k, vitamin d, vitamin a, and at least one b vitamin. Mineral deficiencies are just as common too",
      "It\u2019s mostly marketing. People love the idea that a handful of blueberries or a trendy green powder will somehow \u201cupgrade\u201d their health. Plus, it\u2019s easier to obsess over vitamin content than to fix bigger dietary patterns or lifestyle habits. Superfood hype sells better than telling someone to just sleep more and eat basic vegetables."

      "The fiber is not affected by blending, so you do get all the fiber from your fruits in a smoothie. The biggest difference between eating whole fruit versus drinking a smoothie is the rate at which you consume the fruit, and the amount of fruit you consume. You can consume a smoothie containing a banana, an apple, a mango, several berries, maybe some honey, and some yogurt in 45 seconds easily. How many minutes would it take you to eat that whole? Would you even eat all that before feeling satiated if you had to eat them whole? Since your rate of intake (ie how fast you eat it) is a lot faster with a smoothie, your blood sugar will spike more dramatically, and you may end up consuming more sugar (and fiber, and calories, etc) than if you ate whole fruit until you were full, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. If you like blended smoothies more than whole fruits, eat the smoothies! It's better than a lot of other snacks you could eat.",
      "If you blend one whole fruit versus eating a whole fruit there isn't a huge difference.. the only difference would be the speed at which you are eating this because you're going to consume a smoothie and like a few seconds (also the quantity of fruit is going to seem like a lot less once you blend it so people tend to use more fruit than they would eat) versus having a few minutes to eat a fruit like an apple or something. So yes that alone will have an effect on blood sugar differently. So no eating a whole fruit blended is not the same as soda Pop because you're still getting the fiber and vitamins, and blending fiber doesn't destroy it despite a lot of comment saying it does.. you're still absorbing nutrients as if you chewed a fruit really well. And you are still getting vitamins from the fruit itself which you don't get from pop. Even fruit juice you're getting more vitamins with although when you get rid of all the fiber then it's getting closer to soda pop. Keep in mind though quantity matters the calories are going to be much much higher in liquid juice versus what looks like the same amount of fruit. If you've ever made orange juice with one orange you will know what I'm talking about you need several oranges to make a cup of orange juice this is the problem with the sugar content it's not the blending act itself. However instead of just drinking blended fruit I would add some form of fat and protein and then you have it elevated even above just a regular piece of fruit like if you add some full fat Greek yogurt or whey protein and maybe some nut Butters or something like that now you have a slower digesting food",
      "Whole fruit and blended fruit are pretty similar, but the blended fruit is processed and fibers broken down. This can make digestion easier while also making blood glucose raise more quickly. It\u2019s perfectly healthy for a person with insulin sensitivity and good fasting blood sugar, but may not be the best thing for someone with insulin resistance, diabetes, or metabolic syndrome, particularly if it\u2019s the first meal of the day and/or eaten without protein and fat to blunt the glucose/insulin spike.",
      "Blending fruit is perfectly fine and healthy, assuming equal consumption as whole fruit. In fact, blending fruit with/ seeds (e.g. berries) has a *lower* glycemic response than whole fruit. Source: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9657402/ > We hypothesize that a reduced glycemic response in blended apple and blackberries compared to whole apple and blackberries might be associated with the release of dietary fiber and nutritive components from ground blackberry seeds.",
      "Pretty obvious that soda is different because it has different ingredients and no vitamins. They're probably being sloppy when describing things like glycemic index, rate of absorption, calories without satisfaction. Blended frozen fruit is generally considered healthier than fruit juice or soda in all of those groups because of the fiber. Smoothies are an effective way to eat the daily recommended servings of produce, fiber, and micronutrients."

      "Coming from someone in a country where it IS taught every single year in health class, I'm not convinced it works. Our obesity rate is the [third highest in the world](https://sweetfriends.co.nz/blog/new-zealand-third-fattest-country/) here in New Zealand. It is taught all the way until year 11, or around age 16. I'm not sure how early it starts but from my memory (it's been a while now) I was first exposed to it at age 10/11/12. As I'm unaware of any data supporting the effectiveness of this, I am not confident in backing the statement that this will impact obesity rates by much, if at all. Introducing a nutrition curriculum to public education seems like a very poor return on investment decision and short-sighted solution to a problem that is clearly multifactorial. If it means anything, here's my anecdotal experience from what I remember, as well as what younger siblings of friends have thought about the classes:- None of the kids paid any attention to these classes. The girls would braid each others hair and the boys were drawing penises on the provided booklets.- Kids who were generally more obese/overweight cared about the classes even less, even when it was delivered in a way that shouldn't have been interpreted as fat-shaming.- It's very difficult to teach children/teenagers about a topic as nuanced as nutrition. Regarding the issue being multifactorial, lack of knowledge is not always the main issue. Simply a lack of discipline or motivation is a huge factor, the [attrition rates](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2891-13-13) we see in nutrition studies where diets are planned/designed by highly qualified RDs + MDs strongly suggest that lack of knowledge on execution is unlikely to be a large factor. The article I linked saw an attrition rate of **57% at 6 months.** Is a basic nutrition course designed for kids/teenagers really going to improve adherence to evidence-based nutritional approaches by a noticeable degree? I'm in now way suggesting that government regulation of food marketing is at all an intelligent solution, but that is again, one of the many factors we have to consider. The marketing of calorie dense foods and highly palatable foods by big corporations is everywhere - they skew our concepts of quantifying 'moderation'. Yes, consuming foods in moderation is ok but fast food chains and processed food companies skew our perception of true moderation and portion sizes. There's also the issue of companies promoting certain ingredients or methods of preparation (to no fault of their own, to be fair, they are just trying to meet market demands). An over-emphasis on 'organic' or 'gluten-free' foods, 'brown rice or white rice', 'fresh or frozen veges?', 'low carb or high carb?' for the average individual, whilst completely ignoring the things that really matter for improving body composition - calories consumed VS burnt + adherence. Again, majoring in the minors. EDIT: Typos",
      "It's a pretty multifaceted issue. Why are Americans getting unhealthier? 1) Cost. Fresh produce, whole grains, and quality food in general is expensive. It requires time to prepare, which can also cut into your income, especially if you work multiple jobs and don't have time to make 3 meals a day. 2) Convenience. As mentioned above, meals take a decent amount of time to prepare. Some people never learn to cook for themselves, although it is a very useful skill. Some people travel a lot for work, so end up eating at restaurants which embellish their food with extra salt or sugar. 3) Availability. Not all grocery stores in the US are homogenous in terms of products offered. Some have very limited selections of fresh or frozen produce, but lots of canned or processed vegetables high in sodium and lower in fibre. These are much cheaper than fresh or frozen vegetables to transport, since a lot of consumer goods in the middle of the country rely on long-haul trucks and trains to get food from one place to another rather than fancy (expensive) refrigerated trucks with CO2 added to keep the produce fresh. 4) Sedentary behavior. Humans sit down more than ever, and our lifestyles encourage this. We drive everywhere instead of walking because our infrastructure layout requires us to drive to our workplace as it's simply too far away to travel on foot. We sit for an 8 hour shift at a desk or cubicle, then sit on a sofa or at a desk watching TV or using a computer. Then we go to sleep and do it again. 5) Taste. We love sugar! We're wired to love sugar! In the past, we might gorge ourselves on fruit when it's available for a month or two, but we had to wait for it the entire year, or maybe tuck it away for winter. Our brain hasn't yet made the distinction between an apple and a Snicker's bar, our brains just understand \"Sugar! I know what this is! Fruit! Eat more while it's available!\" Even though you can stop at any corner store in the country and get as many Snicker's bars as you want. 6) Corporate Fuckery. Corporations know we love sugar. They also know corn syrup is dirt cheap, as the production of corn is subsidized by the government and farmers want to offload it to whoever will pay. So they put it into food, knowing we'll love the way it tastes and impulsively buy more of it. It's in everything. Adult males should have no more than 35g of sugar daily. Adult females should have even less, 25g. Most processed food allows that much or more in a *single* serving size, which most people don't pay attention to, they just eat until they're satisfied.",
      "Honestly I feel it's just a waste of time and money. Anyone can do a 5 minute google search and find a healthy diet. My 4 year old knows the difference between what's healthy and not. The biggest issue today is the whole body positive bs. What started as a noble and great thing that taught people that models were not normal and to strive for that could be dangerous for a lot of people. To just letting someone be 50 lbs over weight and pretending it's healthy for them, and it's body positive and wonderful. Being overweight is the leading indicator for everything from diabetes to depression. It is the easiest indicator to see. We need to stop glorifying it.",
      "I don't agree. I think most people know better than they do. It is several things. As we see with current social trends, people don't care about what they know, or what is right or wrong. They care about how they feel. Food makes you feel good. Restaurants and ads massage people's feelings, creating cravings. When I say, \"cook your own foods instead of going to (insert favorite fast food joint)\", I hear, \"I don't know how, it takes too long, or I like the food.\" Food is social. You are mostly influenced by what your friends eat and what they like. I work in a medical facility. Grateful patients and kind co-workers bring in cookies, cakes, pies, etc. People think they are being kind when they do this kind of thing. I used to work in a nursing home. They gave diabetic patients macaroni and cheese, fried chicken, biscuits etc. When I complained they were killing them, they said \"people like what they like, we aren't going to change them now.\" When they made school lunches healthier, parents and kids had fits. They said they were inedible. As long as hyperpalatable food is available, people will want it.",

A week later we had an open discussion in class and a student said that the government had the cure for cancer.

      "Mildly overweight is one thing. Obese is another. Never seen an obese person that wasn't eating a bunch of stuff they know is a bad idea. Eating an entire family sized thing of Oreos in a single sitting isn't something you do because you just don't know better. Obesity is more analogous to to alcohol abuse. No one thinks a liter of vodka every night is healthy, but that's still a thing people do. Education is good, but it's not going to fix the main problem. This is a psychological problem."

      "it's always odd for me to hear this cause even though sometimes nutella has been advertised in italy as a breakfast food (bread and nutella: the breakfast of the champions! with the italian football team), it's common knowledge it's ***not*** a breakfast food. Maybe every once in a while as a special occasion, but I never heard of nobody having breakfast with that. It's mainly seen as a sweet spread you can have sometimes as a snack, or used in desserts or basically a dessert food, so not something you have daily. And adverts always associated it with sport, showing that a correct lifestyle includes sport and exercise. &#x200B; Or, the kind of mid afternoon snack your lovely grandma gives you, as a secret deal, hidden from your parents :P most people have fond childhood memories with grandparents and nutella. But most people in italy agree it's a dessert and should be eaten occasionally, cue nutella jars lasting forever (unless you are addicted to it, like some people I know haha) &#x200B; But yeah, first time I heard of the breakfast thing I was like *WHAT THE FUCK THAT'S NOT OK*",

One night I\u2019m making dinner, her room was actually the living room, and I see her on her bed eating out of a Nutella jar. I then remembered how she told me to help her out if I saw her going against her goals. So I just nicely said, \u201chey there, want to stop with the Nutella, I\u2019m making something delicious and healthy and Nutella is gonna derail your progress. You can have what I\u2019m making\u201d. She responded with \u201cNo, Nutella is hazelnuts. It\u2019s healthy\u201d. Then I tried to tell her how it wasn\u2019t and that she needs to start reading nutrition labels because advertising is false, and I remembered when I first lost weight as an older teen I had to teach myself that just because something is being sold as \u201chealthy\u201d doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s healthy.",

It is much more creamy and sugary to me now then ever before. I prefer the old taste better.

      "Damn, that was amazing. It almost kind of gave me a sense of fasting. It\u2019s ritual of sacrifice, and thus you can apply this fast for the benefit of your ancestors - in their memory or for their spirit. Idk how the laws of life and death and shit work, but I\u2019m pretty sure choosing not to overeat and dedicating that meal to the people before us has some spiritual benefit (even if it\u2019s just avoiding the feeling of sickness caused by gluttony). I\u2019m going to make an edit about your gas tank analogy- think of a hot air balloon. When you take to the sky in a hot air balloon, you need fuel to burn for that initial takeoff (breakfast) throughout the day, you should snack or eat in moderation to keep your balloon afloat. In order to achieve a soft landing, you need to have the right amount of fuel to take you gently to your destination. Not too much and not too little. Overeating is a bad idea, because too much fuel will send your balloon into dangerous heights and surely cause you to come crashing down, one way or another! Thanks for the tools OP! It\u2019s always up to us to use them of course, but this is a very inspirational post because it is really easy and realistic to implement your perspective. Ultimately, there is a physical aspect to keeping motivated and healthy with our eating and activity, but the bigger battle most of us fight has to do with the mental stuff.

Changing the reliance on processed food needs to recognize the challenging time situations parents face, in particular women/mothers. **Changes in Activity**\\- Right, its not only adults.

And, [this restriction increases in urban environments.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20938312/) Kids are moving less in play and every day lives, and these turn into adults that move less. It's not just saying \"Kids should be more active!\", its combating a culture of fear (and a bombardment of technology). That's way more complicated. **Psychology of Scarcity**\\- Food insecurity [impacts about 10% of the population](https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details/?pubid=99281) currently and has impacted generations of the past in ways that [have shaped cultural norms that lean toward over-eating \"empty\" calories](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2531152/). It makes people do all sorts of things, but the general idea is- who knows when we'll have money or food again, so eat- a lot- right now. For our grandparents (or great grand parents) it was The Depression. For our parents (or grand parents) it was WWII. \"Clean your plate- there are kids starving in \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" morphed into \"Get the super size! Its only $0.50 more!\" or \"Let's go to (restaurant)! You get so much for your money!\". As other posts have shown, that one meal could be over 2000 calories, you don't need this to happen often for hunger to tip into over-eating, especially if the food isn't satiating. For parents who are struggling with scarcity mentality, it also says \"You may not be able to afford (insert thing that makes you happy or your child happy), but you CAN afford ice cream/a night out at Chili's, and that gets a smile and tastes and feels good.\" In a sad and non-intuitive way, food insecurity (\"hunger\") is linked to obesity through scarcity psychology and its actions as a result. **Normalization**\\- Just like the sneaky sugar and portion sizes, this is \\*everywhere\\*. [The more obese someone is, the more they inacurately identify their body size](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2833165/90-obese-people-don-t-think-weight-problem.html) ([this includes children](https://norwegianscitechnews.com/2018/01/overweight-children-likely-underestimate-size/)).

The fruit generally tastes so much fucking better. And this is just ONE issue I can point out. I got a bunch more."

      "In a nutshell, one theory is that this is because women were entering the workforce at exponentially higher rates. Despite this, a lot of places during the 50s-70s, when this female workforce growth was happening, women's duties were still to care for the kids, cook all meals, and keep house. In an attempt to prevent men's lives from being further burdened (/s for me but not for society back then) by women's desire to work, processed foods invention/prpduction skyrocketed. (Side note that a major contributing factor to processed foods successes is because militaries all over the world had better developed meal options for militias fighting in wars.) With TV dinners, fast snacks and the founding of the first major fast food chains, companies marketed that men would still have the freedom to not cook which is \"women's work\" and allows the women to provide meals for their family more \"easily\" (you can still see this marketing technique used today in a lot of pre-prepared food ads). Health ideals diet wise at this time too strongly encouraged disordered eating, and the basic nutrition wasn't at all like it is now. This trend of increased processed food consumption kept growing because with the worsening economy in the 70s, and again in early 2000s, more people were relying on convenient, cheap foods that took minimal money and effort to prepare. The economy dips created food deserts in which many people cant access a grocery store and have to rely on convenience stores or fast food restuarsnts for their main source of food. Also, the pace of life kept accelerating leaving people eating meals in around 10mins on average (in the US but the speed of meals have increased in a lot of other places). Taking this all into consideration with the fact that all creatures instinctual want to consume as much energy (calories for humans) as possible with exerting the least amount of energy, fast food is an obvious choice for a lot of people. TLDR: More work + Less time + Base instincts = wanting to eat highest cal foods in fastest time",
      "capitalism. tbh i love junk food i just dont eat much of it and im still fat as hell but i love things that are kind of really junk food like i had a pork noodle soup from thailcious and tbh that is techniclly junk food because egg noodles are made from refined carbs its really no better in that sense than craving salt and vinegar chips. i love those thin egg noddles though especially when they are in asian stock. plenty of people just dont realise the calories of things someone might hink wow thats a healthy lunch cause its got meat and vegetables and stock and spices in it but those egg noodles are a refined carb and that technically junk i mean i have also been eating a lot of hommus lately and AlL of it is made with canola oil not olive oil its not healthy to be consuming those kind of vegetable oils there is junk in most things unless you are making it from scratch at home thats why when i am not at home i usually get a 2 dollar can of fruit in juice from the supermarket for a snack and just eat the fruit leave the juice fruit is expensive as hell or if i really need a meal i try to get thai but everything you eat outside the home you make all of it is just saturated with oil i mean one takeaway a day gonna be at least 1000 calories if you going for a meal what i have found surprising is that places like hungry jacks their junk food meal like burger and fries junior combo has hardly any calories in it in comparison to other foods you would buy out like chinese or piza or some thai food covered in oil its crazy i dunno how the calorie count is so low on a junior whopper meal especially with the sugar free soda its like less than 500 cals",
      "I think it\u2019s a combination of a lot of things. These were also the decades where more women started going back to work instead of everyone being a stay at home mom let\u2019s say in the 70s and especially 80s so convenience food TV dinners were huge. Verizon working women I think was probably one of the most major factors for junk food and processed convenience food! Now of course not everyone has to follow along and buy these things but lifestyles needed to change so this was an easy fix for a lot of families boxed cereals for a quick breakfast as well because now not only was mom tired from her workday and not having the time or wanting to cook a big dinner and she was also busy in the morning getting kids off to school and getting herself ready for work. It\u2019s like anything in life you can make home-cooked meals happen but you need meal planning efficient grocery shopping crockpot etc. And of course the more people buy it the more companies will continue to make it and a heavy addiction to sugar and a desire for immediate gratification play apart as well",

We have no sense of thinking for ourselves, instead we gobble up marketing faster than our box of Oreos. It\u2019s actually the easiest time in human history to be healthy!!! Kitchens at home are well equipped with plenty of accessories to make it easier for those less skilled. So many grocery stores. So much fresh food. Millions of recipes at your finger tips. Thousands of YouTube videos showing you how to do it. Don\u2019t have time to cook? Check your screen time. Guess what - you don\u2019t have to cook to be healthy. Plenty of foods can be eaten minimally. It\u2019s easy to play victim, that\u2019s why so many do it. Take responsibility for your health, nobody else will",
      "My sister (F67) and myself (f59) were talking about this just yesterday. Back in the late 1960's and early 1970's the food my mom offered our family at home for meals changed dramatically. At that time the TV in our home was central in our small living room and it was on every second someone was in the house, and was awake. Our home was inundated with commercials marketing the new fad of processed food. The daily newspaper came with coupons from Kraft, Campbell's, and Lay's. The Sunday paper had a whole section devoted to 'saving money and saving time!' by buying and using processed foods in boxes and cans. Once my mom discovered instant potatoes, I don't think we got fresh mashed ever again. My mom didn't even have a job outside the house until I was 11 (and her youngest kid was in school) But the marketing was relentless, and she was 'saving money' by using all those coupons and taking advantage of 'sales'. Feeding a family of seven was now easy: Breakfast cereals, canned soup and sandwiches of white bread and wrapped American cheese for lunch, and Hot Dogs, canned baked beans and boxed Mac-n-Cheese became our standard meals. Fast food was normalized in the home of working class families long before eating fast food from restaurants every day became the standard. Junk food is as addictive as opioids, and easier to get than healthy foods. Once a person gets our mouth set for all that tasty salt and fats, it's hard to eat otherwise. A diet like that changes a person's whole physiology."

      "There are lots of reasons. Biggest share of the blame obviously goes to the food companies. Highly processed foods are designed pretty much down to the molecular level to be as addictive and palatable as possible. They completely hijack our bodies\u2019 natural response because before industrialization, the presence of foods so high in fat, sugar, and salt would have signaled to our ancestors a very valuable and very rare nutrition source. Now they produce a brain response and pattern of behavior similar to a druggie taking a hit. The introduction of these foods also just so happen to coincide with a more sedentary lifestyle. Modern appliances gave more time for leisure and watching the tv soon became a national pastime. Only a few decades later, computers would be available in many homes and offices. So suddenly people are consuming more calories while simultaneously moving a lot less. The rise in the prevalence of these foods also just so happens to largely coincide with more women entering the workforce. This left less time for cooking, and convenience became one of the most important factors. This meant families that had previously been eating food cooked almost entirely from scratch were now eating much more processed food. Now, cooking is quickly becoming a lost art. In modern times, people are completely ignorant about what constitutes a healthy lifestyle. Social media has allowed these fringe \u201cfat activists\u201d groups to run rampant and further confuse people. You now have people that have completely shirked any and all responsibility as to their own lack of health, but they wouldn\u2019t know where to start if they cared or took responsibility. You also have a growing number of people that are either ignorant or apathetic to the dangers of obesity. Another problem is affordability. Unfortunately the least healthy foods tend to be the cheapest thanks to government subsidies on wheat and corn. Impoverished communities also unfortunately tend to be less educated so they are at a further disadvantage of not knowing which foods are better choices or how to prepare them even if they could afford them. However, we might actually be at a turning point where we may begin to see the problem ever so slightly/slowly correct itself. The terrible economy has forced people to make choices they\u2019ve never had to. With rising prices many people suddenly can\u2019t afford chips, soda, and the like. And while McDonalds could once feed a family of four for just a few bucks, it can now rival a casual sit down establishment in terms of price. Meaning people might actually be forced to learn how to cook. And while many many tiktok \u201chealth gurus\u201d are spreading dangerous misinformation or just trying to extort money from people, I think their sudden rise in popularity might be an indication that the culture is shifting more towards health. So as bad as things are, there might just maybe be a silver lining.",
      "At the end of the day, I believe it\u2019s simply more and more people making bad decisions. The only way to fix the issue is for people to take personal accountability and stop purchasing the unhealthy foods. I think it\u2019s a very sad world view to believe that human beings are powerless and pre-destined to consume hamburgers and pizza until all of society is morbidly obese. If you have an elementary education then you know that greasy hamburgers and French fries are unhealthy. Yet each day, people continue to purchase these items. Many people also eat perfectly healthy, just less and less in recent times. Yes, unhealthy foods are oftentimes addictive since they contain sugar, that doesn\u2019t mean personal accountability gets thrown out the window. At the end of the day it\u2019s still up to you whether you eat healthy or not. There are healthy options being marketed just like unhealthy options. Yes, the producers pushing unhealthy foods are partially to blame, the consumers driving the market are also partially to blame.",

      "Ultra-capitalism plus manipulation from government and large cooperations over a good century. The same tricks of misinformation cigarette companies were playing are the same tricks being pulled today in food and medicine. Everyone in the west was conditioned to consume as part of WWII ending and it has been taken to the extreme like cocaine addicts that can't be stopped. Your government is INTENTIONALLY fattening its population so they can then medicate you and then chop you up like cattle. Ask farmers what they feed cattle and its basically the SAD; US has created the equivalent of the devils paradise on earth; indulge all you want until you get chopped up. Through ignorance and misinformation they will ruin your food sources, water, air; then you will be at the mercy of your cooperate overlords while they sell you processed chemical junk like vegan diets and rancid oils.

They constantly scroll on social media while stuffing their faces with the most convenient food available. Instead of exercising, drinking water, and general self improvement. Then they complain about how difficult it is to eat healthy foods, somehow convincing themselves that being fat and lazy isn\u2019t their fault. I don\u2019t care if I get downvoted to oblivion. It needs to be said. The fact that America has both an obesity epidemic and a hunger crisis is proof; something needs to change drastically."

The only times we *ever* ate out were end of season dinners when my and sister and I played team sports in middle school. There were never chips or cereal or pop tarts or frozen foods served in our home. We ate a lot of Cajun style foods and soul food.

      "Yeah, like it or not, capitalism means that our food, our nutrition is driven by profit, not health. And the cheap, tastiest food is going to sell the best. Grind up some cheap basics (white flour, corn, etc), toss enough salt, fat, and sugar into it, and it's absolutely going to taste good, and it's also going to be super cheap to make. And because that kind of food is a huge profit driver, we got REALLY good at making it. The added benefit - food with lots of salt and sugar lasts longer too. That processed sugar bomb can sit on the shelf and outlast 100 rounds of vegetables that come and go. Our processed, sugary food is VERY shelf stable.

How are others here maintaining good nutrition affordably? Do you have go-to strategies for eating well on a budget or for finding healthy options that don\u2019t feel like a chore?

      "It's a system problem that can be overcome individually. Wanting to change the system is good, but effecting change on an individual level - via personal choice - is immediately effective.

This line of thinking removes agency from the self and should be avoided whenever possible as it leads to a sense of defeat. Is it easier to change a pervasive multi-billion dollar industry or to change one's own choices of what to put in one's body? So many people act as if being healthy is *supposed* to be the easiest path for most people. It's not. Temptation is around every corner, and things worth doing are rarely easy. You wanna fight against the system? Start by putting your money where your mouth is, and make conscious choices toward a healthier lifestyle. Nobody else is going to do that for you, not big sugar, not big pharma - just you. Nobody ever said it was easy. Empowering the individual is the best - and oftentimes the only - thing one can do for their health.",

They are limited to rationing production thus inflating the price and putting the Americans in charge of bumping up the price with demand. Give tax levies to organic local production and allow less enforcement to food production like cottage food law production. This would risk disease and spoilage but again it is the responsibility of the American people to decide where to buy from. If inflation keeps bumping up prices, the risk would be having those India street food vendors where they cook by reusing scraps and again that would be the risk of the American people to decide because if local food production starts getting stingy and bumping up the prices, then the consequences would be to cater poor quality to the poor to make profit. This would repeat your broken system at a more local level except it would be less controlled and more up to the people. It might invite the center of disease control into our footsteps since the demand for junk food would rise giving the possibility of local shops bumping up speed in production ignoring some food safety guidelines. Thus making local shops step in on the demand and it would take more tax to overview these localities to give quality and clean production.

      "There is one thing that gets excluded from most debates about how to lose weight or eat healthy. Calories to an extent is important, but we need to look at the bigger picture and see how hormones in our body react to certain foods as they can play just as an important role in determining whether fat get released or stored. Looking at healthy eating from a qualitative perspective will help everyone better understand that the foods you eat can impact stuff like insulin, leptin, and ghrelin hormones which can communicate different messages to our body. For example, fat is assumed to be the leading cause for weight gain when it has next to no effect on insulin, the fat storage hormone. Whereas carbohydrates is the most recommended macronutrients in the food pyramid that we're given by our current health system. Carbohydrates is known to have the highest effect on insulin causing you to store more fat. The basis of energy usage goes in this order: Carbohydrates > Fat > Protein. The body doesn't try to use stored energy if it doesn't have a need to do so. This is where most people run into trouble with losing fat. They're not aware of the fact that they have to deplete their carbohydrates first, then the body will start tapping into fat storages afterwards. You wouldn't use a generator when you already have a stable power supply at hand. It would make sense to use it during a power outage because that's when you'll really need it. The same concept applies to stored fat. I'm not trying to promote a ketogenic lifestyle, but the bottom line is that you have to know how the human body utilizes energy and the cause and effect of various components within foods.",
      "It\u2019s true. I think people over emphasize calories. Calories are important to weight loss though. But the really interesting parts of nutrition are all the other things like what is better sugar or starch, saturated or unsaturated fats, vegetables or fruit, what are the best protein sources, how to best get the vitamins and minerals, how do foods affect inflammation and metabolism. Those things are more important to overall health than reducing calories.",
      "I think it's a balancing act. I made myself a healthy, nutritious new lunch today and quite liked it, but it wasn't suuuper filling and I was looking forward to dinner. Then I added up the calories and boom - I'm already at 80% RDI. Great. So I'll have to have a light dinner that still needs to deliver certain nutrients. That limits me in my options. Usually I'd go \"Who cares if I'm going a bit carb-heavy today, this meal will cover my fibre needs\" or \"I'll go a bit fatty today, but at least I'll get all my protein, so what\". Carbs and fats can both carry lots of calories. It would've been easier to achieve my nutrition goals today if I had have more calories to spare. Hence why I'm one of those people looking out for low calorie meals: They give me way more freedom to meet my nutrition needs without overloading.",
      "I agree with what your saying, but life is about balance. I like to look at things from an 80/20 perspective. When discussing food from a health standpoint, eating the right amount and the proper macronutrients is the 80%. You can live a healthy, fit life focusing only on ensuring proper caloric intake. For people who have that 80% figured out, and are not focusing on losing weight, they can start looking at the other 20%. Trying to limit the amount of additives and preservatives can make a big difference in the way you feel, and could potentially help to avoid long term issues associated with \"non foods\", such as artificial sweeteners, low fat substitutes, and food dyes. However, focusing on this when you don't have the first 80% straightened out is mostly a waste of effort. I have a very healthy diet, so I like to focus on the last 20%. Recently however, my MiL was diagnosed with T2 Diabetes. The advice I give her is to only focus on carbs/sugars and calories. I don't love to see her eating frozen/prepared food instead of whole food, but if that's wat it takes for her to stay within her calories and macros for the day/week, I see it as a huge win.",
      "Alot of people have said that without weight loss in the equation (which you don't mention anything about) then your statement makes perfect sense. However as someone who is trying to lose weight, abet slowly, I also agree. I will often eat more calories of nutrient dense or more natural food than I do things filled with sugar etc. Because I find them more filling and satisfying. Honestly changing my diet to go from many more quick meals etc to eating alot of rice, salad etc and just being aware of portions I have lost weight at a healthy rate and have been honestly surprised at how little I think about/obsess about food. I still enjoy sugar and cake just in moderation and would often much prefer humus and/or crackers as I find they fill me up for longer. Often although healthier more nutrient dense food can look like alot of calories most of the time you just can't eat as much of it as you would other less satisfying foods so you often eat less. But I don't count calories tbh so that's largely a guess. Anyway I agree whole heartedly and think focusing more on what you eat than counting calories builds much healthier habits and just is much better for you."

      "That's not the reason people are fat - it's lack of discernment, education, and lifestyle factors as lack of the time or energy to make healthy meals. Plus food is the cheapest and most accessible form of therapy for the mental health impacts of the inequalities society involves and how that affects marginalized people. As well as this is how junk food is designed to be addictive, as another commenter said. It's definitely difficult to find healthy food out and about. Much better to always have healthy snacks with you. Even if a restaurant appears healthy, the food served is loaded with hidden extra fat, salt, and sugar to make it more desirable."

      "Hellooo I\u2019m a nutrition student and I\u2019m going to write my dissertation on this. These dense areas of fast food are called food swamps. They are also similarly located in areas called food deserts (where there isn\u2019t access to a local supermarket and fresh produce) There\u2019s a lot of socioeconomic factors that come into play here but lots of fast food outlets are usually found in poorer deprived areas where people don\u2019t have access to supermarkets via cars and local transport. Also it\u2019s cheaper for poorer families to pay for higher calorie fattier foods that feed their family than to pay for expensive, lower calorie fresh foods from the shops (if they have access and even the education on how to eat healthy) Other factors come into play like race, sex, pay etc. Also.. you\u2019ll find fast food all over major cities and student areas as this is where they can make the most profits. Anyway.. we need more access healthier foods and takeaways etc!!! It\u2019s a shame that unhealthy food is usually more addictive and cheaper",

The obesity rate in this county is high. It's sad when I see obese people with equally obese children waddling around with soda and fast food bags.",

Prior to this it was common practice for companies to add honey or some type of fruit juice to a food to increase sweetness while making the ingredients not look so bad. Now, there is a list for added sugars that includes things like honey and fruit juice so consumers know that there are still large amounts of sugar and that they are coming from sources other than direct plain sugar. As far as the serving sizes go they aren't really \"changing\" serving sizes on a large scale although some serving sizes have been adjusted because the old labeling laws were made more than 20 years ago. The biggest change here is that companies will be required to include regular serving sizes a long with a completely separate nutrition facts panel directly to the right and adjacent to the normal one that has calories of the whole package if the product is normally consumed all at once. Things like candy bars and sodas are good examples. Just makes it more straight forward so you dont have to do math in your head.

Another reason why this tip is so good is because you can start by ADDING water, instead of restricting yourself from something you want. Over time this will make you feel good drinking the water and not want the unhealthy stuff.

      "OP, Learning about public health and the social determinants of health will give you an in depth understanding and more context to what you\u2019re looking for. Proper nutrition is certainly not unimportant and unstressed in modern society. It\u2019s that government/policies don\u2019t create systems to make it as easily accessible as unhealthy options. All they need to do is make it as easily accessible for individuals to make it important to them. They instead make something like long working hours more important than health/wellness. That person is then exhausted and finds the first thing available to them. You have several other layers of factors explained later on this comment. I can see your heart and frustrations here but you need to learn more about public health to understand the WHYs to your question. You seem to be very passionate and I\u2019m curious what area of work you\u2019re in. Because there is a lot of stress and calls to prevention with healthy eating within the health promotion/education field. The resources are there if you need them. I work in the field of health promotion. Things are done at a smaller scale at the organization I work for so I have close proximity to the individuals we work with. I can see positive change on this level and I believe it makes an impact even if it\u2019s small. I had the same level of anger/passion but I realized it\u2019s much bigger than I initially thought. It\u2019s not something that can be addressed like a pandemic, it\u2019s much deeper than that. But again no forced policy in the world would make people become less obese. In fact even MORE harm than good will arise if policies like such were implemented. I\u2019m from Canada and there was a time during covid restrictions where they taped off the chips and snacks aisles in big grocery stores stopping people from buying them. That small act alone was enough to cause a ruckus, let alone more active measures to shut down things for the sake of obesity. That\u2019s never happening for the sanity of our population. You will understand that a chronic disease like obesity will never work with an intervention at pandemic level approach. Covid-19 was a novel virus. It was new, serious and everyone was affected by it at the same time. Obesity is caused by SO MANY FACTORS. There\u2019s no one size fits all because you first need to ask why that person/community is at risk of becoming obese and work to address those risk factors. Yes its individual lifestyle choices but it\u2019s more directly impacted by environment, policies and socioeconomic status. There are far too many factors and variables to look at before asking \u201cwhy aren\u2019t we addressing about obesity\u201d. There\u2019s mental health and depression. There\u2019s city planning. There\u2019s lack of access to gyms and hundreds of more reasons that will explain how it\u2019s deep systemic issues that created this obesity epidemic. It\u2019s not simply individual choices. Lastly, I can give you an amazing example of how Scandinavian countries or South Africa has a government that helps to create incentivized programs for individuals to choose better food options. There\u2019s been research done to show the health outcomes of these interventions that would be interesting to read. As an example: You get these vouchers from your doctor that give you a discount for produce, meats. You get discounts to local gyms. The government SUPPORTS the wellness of their citizens. It encourages, helps and empowers them to make healthy decision. It doesn\u2019t add a tax or other ridiculous interventions to stop people from buying junk food. Sometimes policies can be required and effective. But certainly not something where lifestyle is involved. Food is emotional - a huge part of life. It\u2019s directly influenced by your income. Socioeconomic status (especially income) is the biggest determinant of health. Exercise is both reliant on individual lifestyle AND environment/urban planning. So interventions need to understand and work strongly with awareness of that. Countries in the west simply don\u2019t do this (sadly) and until they do we can forget about any improvement on the obesity epidemic.",
      "Individuals don\u2019t have the time to wake up. Usually they are busy doing the grind. The information is out there but as everybody has a different situation (think of fresh food deserts, incomes, transportation, etc) oftentimes the things people think is \u2018universally available\u2019 is \u2018not so available as it seems\u2019. Healthy food and drink options are some of those. As far as habit change goes, we are very malleable. To change your habits you have to intentionally change what information you consume. It has to become deliberate. Turning off the tv helps. That takes years (probably more than 10) before you start to overcome the negative effects of it. Lucky TV is less common. So today it\u2019s more about subscribing to feeds or channels or forums or following people who create strengths and health. Not only simply accepting data feeds curated by others, but activity curating your own. This means unsubscribing from the addictive fun things. Eg. I love so many subreddits, I sub, I get a taste, go \u2018holey shit that\u2019s really fun and great!\u2019 Then rapidly unsubscribe with a thought \u2018no way do I have the self control to avoid spending all day enjoying that!\u2019 It\u2019s a bit like being presented with options that are enjoyable or options that are important but confronting or difficult and stressful. I tend to choose the ones that are a challenge to enjoy. Not because I enjoy the challenge either, but because it\u2019s the more important thing.",
      "The last one hundred years of progression has definitely skewed our Neuro-chemicals,specifically Dopamine rewarding options.And with a government that promoted a ridiculous Food Pyramid many years back and invested no real funding to educate folks that sugar is actually toxic to our bodies could perhaps play a role here.

Odd considering that cholesterol and cardiovascular disease and metabolic issues from sugar and carbohydrates are still not quite fully understood.And the FDA approves drugs that either don't really work or have an unknown mode or mechanism of action.And then they have the balls to treat all these idiopathic and unknown CVD's and neuro- degenerative ailments with poorly understood and seldomly tested pharmaceutical meds. The food we grow,manufacture and promote is unsatisfactory.Ninety percent is not healthy.But the World needs to eat, so the uneducated and misinformed folks consume it. If more folks get wise and decide to eat healthy it may take a while for the industry catch up with new agricultural and production facilities. I was not surprised hearing the recent news that the NIH admitted that high HDL Cholesterol levels offered no benefits regarding mortality rates for cardiovascular diseases.But that I knew for three years now.So some things which are promoted as healthy control measures by the medical industry to optimize things could very well prove bogus years from now. Hard to trust these professionals who, like most of us, may not completely know the score.",
      "Sadly a major reason it isn't discussed more is because of the PC Police. Not to make it political, but I'm a left leaning liberal and I don't complain about \"hurt feelings\" very often. However in this case, so many people struggle with weight, that trying to push nutrition education is very likely to offend people who believe they have tried everything and nothing works. There is a lot of social conditioning that happens both telling people they shouldn't be fat, but also it's not their fault they are. The truth is somewhere in the middle. Virtually no one thinks they have no control of their weight, but most people who struggle with it think they've tried everything and nothing works. Fast food is big business. Fad diet plans are big business. Home workout machines are big business. Weight loss meal plans are big business. There is also a huge component of people who really don't understand the basics, but because they are self conscious, they don't want someone fit telling them about calories or macros. It sounds patronizing. Instead they fill their shopping cart with \"diet\" or \"organic\" or \"low fat\" or \"sugar free\" foods and assume it's healthy. It's easier to buy food that tells you it's healthy, than to learn what makes food healthy. It also lets you enjoy your 2l bottle of soda and bag of chips if both say \"fat free'.",

So I have no idea how people _still_ think that it\u2019s flying under the radar; it\u2019s misguided. And finally, weight status is the result of a complex series of factors that include nutrition but are not primarily driven by it. Without addressing other factors like access to healthcare, poverty, education, workers\u2019 rights, and other things that could be loosely grouped under social justice/equity initiatives, and how they relate to levels of chronic inflammation, stress, etc. we cannot effectively help people.

In this case, public health measures targeting obesity (such as taxing or banning unhealthy foods or educational materials that encourage a negative association with fat, calories, sugar, etc.) cause a lot of harm in the form of eating disorders while doing nothing to actually reduce obesity. Obesity is largely caused by built environment such as food deserts, lack of access to a gym or safe neighborhoods to exercise outdoors, busy work schedules, and poverty. Tackling obesity means address those issues, not shaming people for their eating habits.",
      "Arguably, doctors get yelled at for bringing up weight because people hate being told they're doing something \"wrong.\" They don't want to be told they're eating \"poorly\" because in some cases people can't afford better food or just don't fully appreciate that the options in the supermarket are not great for the human body. But also, you get a lot of disordered eating because \"eat less\" and \"track calories\" and \"exercise more\" gets pumped into our brains.

      "My dad is the Chair of Anesthesia at the U of U hospital, a world-renowned researcher in pharmacokinetics, studied at Stanford, etc. Yet he and most of his colleagues (some of the best MDs in Utah) are so focused on treating disease that optimizing health just isn\u2019t a part of their wheelhouse. I realize this isn\u2019t representative of all MDs, but I have been exposed to a lot of accomplished MDs and I\u2019m almost always surprised by their lack of interest/know-how when it comes to optimizing health/performance (especially the older MDs). Most of them seem to eat whatever they want while despising the nutraceutical industry with OP\u2019s logic. The only reason I would go to any of them is to treat disease/injury. I understand where OP\u2019s coming from, but when one reads posts like these it can give the impression that one shouldn\u2019t be curious or conscious of where they\u2019re getting all their micronutrients from and/or that it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019re deficient in any of them. On the whole\u2014aside from uninformed/anxious people that are unreasonably worried about deficiencies\u2014I don\u2019t think this is very helpful. There are undoubtedly a significant amount of people that immediately benefit from supplementing Vit D, K2, B12, Magnesium, Iodine, Iron, Creatine, etc. (According to the NIH micronutrient deficiencies affect at least 2 Billion people worldwide; yes most are in developing countries but that # is not insignificant...) These posts also don\u2019t seem to acknowledge that our modern, post-industrial, polluted, toxin-laden lifestyle may demand more nutrients than food can provide, especially with how modern farming techniques & fertilizers have depleted our soil of nutrients, which decreases the beneficial vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants in conventionally-grown crops. And lastly, these posts also don\u2019t seem to acknowledge the significant difference between surviving and thriving. Examining the nuance of my micronutrient intake and experimenting with various supplements I might benefit from / foods I might be sensitive to has helped lead to optimal performance for me as opposed to simply avoiding scurvy (or other malnutrition related diseases).",
      "My friend, whilst your point about the negligable incidence of scurvy and rickets is true, and I agree that most people on a vaguely balanced diet are likely fine, you can\u2019t just dismiss the medical relevance of the entirety of micronutrition. As others have pointed out, iodine, vitamin D, Iron, B9 and B12 are quite common deficiencies whether a doctor picks up on them or not. In fact, these are deficiencies plaguing the lower classes in the U.K. at the moment. Also understand that a micronutrient deficiency is a very grey area in most cases, and there are often phenotypic implications for subclinical deficiencies that it would be difficult to trace back to a deficiency. Nutrition is a complex science that you simply don\u2019t learn the molecular orchestration of in medical school, so please be aware of this rather than dismissive of it. Respect your hospital dietitians! Please don\u2019t give diet advice, you haven\u2019t studied the science!",

I have also taken iron in the past for deficiency but was like a 3 month treatment, not forever. I feel like a lot of people, specially young healthy people, don\u2019t need a bunch of vitamin pills every day.",
      "I honestly thing that most vitamins in particular are quite easy to get enough of, especially for people who eat meat. And Vitamin C is basically a no-brainer. But for girls and women that are fertile, Iron can certainly be a problem. For dark skinned people or people living in places with little sun, Vitamin D can be a problem. Testing people for nutrient deficiency is not always an accurate representation of their nutritional status. Calcium is stored primarily in the bones, which is where your body will take it from if you are running low, so your blood levels may look normal even though you are at risk for developing osteoperosis. This is anecdotal but I wanted to test my dog to make sure he gets everything he needs, and they basically told me it would be wasted money because it is not always accurate. My partner had an eating disorder years ago but had perfect bloodwork. &#x200B; I suppose it is fairly easy for someone who exercises regularly, or has a fair amount of muscle to get enough nutrients, since their calorie budget will be larger. But for anyone who for any reason needs to eat a calorie restricted diet, it can be quite difficult to reach minimum requirements and still eat an enjoyable diet. I personally have plenty of symptoms of iron deficiency, which tends to get better after a while of supplementing with iron. I also tend to develop a strange pain in my gum and teeth if I don't supplement Vitamin D during the winter. &#x200B; With that said I don't actually even like supplements in the first place, and try my best to avoid them when I can, especially since it's an unregulated business. I do however believe that a lot of people would benefit from a more nutritionally complete natural diet, and it is not just about nutrients as we have come to define them, but things like flavonoids etc as well.",

      "Liver. It's like the perfect multivitamin and enzyme supplement made by nature. It\u2019s rich in protein, low in calories and packed with essential vitamins and minerals. Along with other organ meats, such as heart, kidney, brain, etc, liver used to be a very popular food. However, muscle meats now tend to be favored over organ meats. Regardless of its declining popularity, liver is possibly one of the most nutrient-dense foods on the planet. People often look to fruits and vegetables for vitamins and minerals, but liver far surpasses them all in terms of nutrient content. A small amount of liver provides well over 100% of the RDI for many essential nutrients: * Vitamin B12: 3,460% of the RDI. Vitamin B12 helps the formation of red blood cells and DNA. It is also involved in healthy brain function. * Vitamin A: 860\u20131,100% of the RDI. Vitamin A is important for normal vision, immune function and reproduction. It also helps organs like the heart and kidneys function properly. * Riboflavin (B2): 210\u2013260% of the RDI. Riboflavin is important for cellular development and function. It also helps turn food into energy. * Folate (B9): 65% of the RDI. Folate is an essential nutrient that plays a role in cell growth and the formation of DNA. * Iron: 80% of the RDI, or 35% for women of menstruating age. Iron is another essential nutrient that helps carry oxygen around the body. The iron in liver is heme iron, the kind most easily absorbed by the body. * Copper: 1,620% of the RDI. Copper acts like a key to activate a number of enzymes, which then help regulate energy production, iron metabolism and brain function. * Choline: Liver provides all of the Adequate Intake (AI) for women and nearly all of it for men (AI is used because there is insufficient evidence to set an RDI). Choline is important for brain development and liver function.",

Now when shit gets tough, chronic pain flares up, even though I control all my macro and micro variables for what I eat, main thing what I always do and recommend to friends and family members- get fucking lean and drop as much fluff as possoble. And it always works incredibly well. Fix the nutrition and start doing the hard yards- training, whatever that will be. Step by step and build. Then look at sleep and recovery. Optimze that. Stay there. Make uncomfortable feel comfortable because you are doing the right things which will pay dividends down the line. Now this is just a few thoughts while im doing my cardio 1hr15min in already and thinking to do a bit more. Also Elimination works the best because we as humans and society have become nothing else but users and consumers day in and day out.

A curious thing about \"trust your gut\" is that like with hearts synching in bed between couples, the gut does something similar before any chemical thing between people, and doesn't have language like the brain does, so when they say \"trust your gut\" with someone, that really can lie or be lied to - and there are probably diets that can factor in to how clouded or clear that might leave people. It's fascinating stuff, really!",

      "I've seen a lot of evidence that it plays a major role. There are studies linking gut health to mental illness and/or recovery from it. There are studies of using gut-based treatments including probiotics and dietary changes to treat depression and other mental health conditions. It's poorly-understood, but the preliminary evidence seems to suggest the effect is potentially large. There are many different potential mechanisms, including: * Poor gut health just leading people to feel bad due to unpleasant symptoms, which is an additional stressor that can worsen mental health * Poor gut health blocking absorption of nutrients, leading to deficiencies that can worsen mental health * Poor gut health resulting in the creation and/or absorption of toxins and/or other harmful compounds which can negatively effect mental health * Good gut health facilitating absorption of nutrients, and even synthesis of those nutrients in the gut * Good gut health (esp. through high fiber intake) resulting in more stable blood sugar which stabilizes mood swings * Gut health modulating the immune system, and infections elsewhere in the body then influencing mental health There may be some more mechanisms I forgot, and there are also likely many mechanisms that haven't even been discovered yet. Also, anecdotally, in my own life, how I eat seems to play a big role in my mental health. Also, the relationship between gut health and mental health is likely bidirectional. Gut health influences mental health, but mental health also influences gut health. Again, there are multiple mechanisms through which this can happen: * Poor mental health elevating stress level which reduces the \"rest and digest\" nervous system, thus harming gut health. * Poor mental health increasing cravings for unhealthy foods, disrupting gut health. * Poor mental health leading to more disordered eating habits, similarly disrupting gut health. * Poor mental health suppressing or weakening the immune system, thus increasing the risk and/or severity of infections in the gut. * Good mental health making people think more rationally about diet and eating, thus improving gut health. * Good mental health making people be more on top of their life so that they have more resources with which to eat healthier. So basically both the gut and the brain are parts of systems that are interconnected in multiple ways, and a healthy state in one helps keep the other in a healthy state too.",

      "> Vitamin deficiencies are extremely uncommon among people in developed countries who eat a reasonably varied diet. This is not necessarily true. Vitamin D deficiency is common and widespread in northern latitudes. Folate deficiency is relatively common. B12 deficiency is common in vegans and some vegetarians. B6 deficiency is common in people with certain conditions, like Celiac disease or people who consume a lot of alcohol. Although scurvy from extreme vitamin C deficiency is rare, levels of Vitamin C consumption far lower than optimal for health are common. Nutrient density matters. If your staples are white rice, things made of refined wheat flour, corn products, iceberg lettuce, grapes, apples, and cherries, and you always eat boneless, skinless meats, you might be deficient in quite a few vitamins. > Why then are people so keen on talking about \u201csuperfoods\u201d and paying money for expensive berries, kale and \u201cshots\u201d? Because nutrient density matters. If your staples are beans and legumes, nuts, seeds, berries, bell peppers, kiwi, citrus, broccoli, skin-on meats, organ meats, or whole meats (such as small fish, shellfish, etc.) you are unlikely to end up with these deficiencies. Yes, \"superfood\" can be a bit of a marketing scam...but...foods are not all equally nutritious. Like take apples and oranges. One typical navel orange has 92% RDA vitamin C, 12% folate, 8% B1, 7% B6, 5% potassium, 5% Calcium, 4% magnesium. Whereas, one typical red delicious apple has negligible vitamin C, no more than 5% of any vitamins: 5% Vitamin K, 4% B6, 4% B2, and 3% B1 and E. It also has 5% potassium, but only 1% calcium, 3% Magnesium And apples aren't the worst food out there, nor are oranges necessarily a superfood. The point I am making is that nutrient density is wildly different in different foods. Some foods are so high in particular nutrients that if you eat even modest amounts, you will get more than enough of those nutrients. Other nutrients don't really help you that much in any way. For example if you eat pumpkin seeds regularly, you probably always have enough magnesium. If you eat parsley regularly (even in small amounts) you probably get enough vitamin K. If you eat any dried shiitake mushrooms, you probably get enough B5 (pantothenic acid). If you eat oranges or bell peppers, you probably get enough vitamin C. If you eat mussels, clams, or oyster, you probably get enough B12, and if you eat oyster you probably get enough Zinc and probably Iron too. If you eat green lentils, you probably get enough folate and probably get enough of most of the B-vitamins. And so on. The little details matter.",
      "Like sure, people who eat a varied diet may not have vitamin deficiency, but the reality is that the average person doesn't eat eat a varied diet and survive off of highly processed food. * [Approximately 35 to 40% of adults in the United States have vitamin D deficiency](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9573946/) * [Around half \\(48%\\) of the US population consumes less than the recommended amount of magnesium from food](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5786912/) * [Specifically**, 94.3% of the US population do not meet the daily requirement for vitamin D, 88.5% for vitamin E, 52.2% for magnesium, 44.1% for calcium, 43.0% for vitamin A, and 38.9% for vitamin C. For the nutrients in which a requirement has not been set, 100% of the population had intakes lower than the AI for potassium, 91.7% for choline, and 66.9% for vitamin K.** The prevalence of inadequacies was low for all of the B vitamins and several minerals, including copper, iron, phosphorus, selenium, sodium, and zinc \\(see Table 1\\). Moreover, more than 97% of the population had excessive intakes of sodium, defined as daily intakes greater than the age-specific UL \\(26\\).](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/micronutrient-inadequacies/overview)",
      "There\u2019s a lot more to phytonutrients than just the vitamins you would know from a multi. There are myriad bioactive compounds in whole foods that are still being heavily researched.

One more example, sulphuraphane in broccoli, not a vitamin or mineral but it\u2019s major for reducing brain inflammation. I could list literally millions more. Thats not even touching your macros; you\u2019ve got to eat so you might as well eat healthy.

      "The fiber is not affected by blending, so you do get all the fiber from your fruits in a smoothie. The biggest difference between eating whole fruit versus drinking a smoothie is the rate at which you consume the fruit, and the amount of fruit you consume. You can consume a smoothie containing a banana, an apple, a mango, several berries, maybe some honey, and some yogurt in 45 seconds easily. How many minutes would it take you to eat that whole? Would you even eat all that before feeling satiated if you had to eat them whole? Since your rate of intake (ie how fast you eat it) is a lot faster with a smoothie, your blood sugar will spike more dramatically, and you may end up consuming more sugar (and fiber, and calories, etc) than if you ate whole fruit until you were full, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. If you like blended smoothies more than whole fruits, eat the smoothies! It's better than a lot of other snacks you could eat.",
      "If you blend one whole fruit versus eating a whole fruit there isn't a huge difference.. the only difference would be the speed at which you are eating this because you're going to consume a smoothie and like a few seconds (also the quantity of fruit is going to seem like a lot less once you blend it so people tend to use more fruit than they would eat) versus having a few minutes to eat a fruit like an apple or something. So yes that alone will have an effect on blood sugar differently. So no eating a whole fruit blended is not the same as soda Pop because you're still getting the fiber and vitamins, and blending fiber doesn't destroy it despite a lot of comment saying it does.. you're still absorbing nutrients as if you chewed a fruit really well. And you are still getting vitamins from the fruit itself which you don't get from pop. Even fruit juice you're getting more vitamins with although when you get rid of all the fiber then it's getting closer to soda pop. Keep in mind though quantity matters the calories are going to be much much higher in liquid juice versus what looks like the same amount of fruit. If you've ever made orange juice with one orange you will know what I'm talking about you need several oranges to make a cup of orange juice this is the problem with the sugar content it's not the blending act itself. However instead of just drinking blended fruit I would add some form of fat and protein and then you have it elevated even above just a regular piece of fruit like if you add some full fat Greek yogurt or whey protein and maybe some nut Butters or something like that now you have a slower digesting food",
      "Whole fruit and blended fruit are pretty similar, but the blended fruit is processed and fibers broken down. This can make digestion easier while also making blood glucose raise more quickly. It\u2019s perfectly healthy for a person with insulin sensitivity and good fasting blood sugar, but may not be the best thing for someone with insulin resistance, diabetes, or metabolic syndrome, particularly if it\u2019s the first meal of the day and/or eaten without protein and fat to blunt the glucose/insulin spike.",
      "Blending fruit is perfectly fine and healthy, assuming equal consumption as whole fruit. In fact, blending fruit with/ seeds (e.g. berries) has a *lower* glycemic response than whole fruit. Source: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9657402/ > We hypothesize that a reduced glycemic response in blended apple and blackberries compared to whole apple and blackberries might be associated with the release of dietary fiber and nutritive components from ground blackberry seeds.",
      "Pretty obvious that soda is different because it has different ingredients and no vitamins. They're probably being sloppy when describing things like glycemic index, rate of absorption, calories without satisfaction. Blended frozen fruit is generally considered healthier than fruit juice or soda in all of those groups because of the fiber. Smoothies are an effective way to eat the daily recommended servings of produce, fiber, and micronutrients."

      "I\u2019ve been using Chat GPT to help with my meal planning the past month or so. I put in what style of cuisine I want to eat for the next two weeks, i.e.; Asian, Comfort Food, Mexican, etc., what type of proteins to use, and have it generate not only a list of recipes, but also put those recipes into a rotation where I never eat the same thing twice in a row. I meal prep for both lunch and dinner, so this is definitely a bonus. I also have it adapt the recipes to my instant pot and slow cooker, which makes clean up a breeze. Here is a sample of what I\u2019ve input and received for the next two weeks, and the recipe rotation. My input: Make a rotating recipe list for lunch and dinner the next two weeks using these ingredients: Boneless chicken breasts Smoked beef sausage Cream cheese Shredded Colby Jack Frozen mixed vegetables Pinto beans Canned whole kernel corn Green beans Diced tomatoes with green chilis Hummus Low carb tortillas Fresh diced tomatoes Bell pepper strips Celery sticks Fresh jalape\u00f1o\u2019s Enchilada sauce Jasmine rice ChatGPT results: Here\u2019s a 2-week rotating recipe plan for lunch and dinner using the ingredients you listed. Each meal is diabetic-friendly, balanced, and makes the most of your pantry and freezer without needing extra shopping. \u2e3b WEEK 1 Monday \u2022 Lunch: Chicken Veggie Wraps \u2013 Saut\u00e9 diced chicken, frozen mixed vegetables, and bell pepper strips. Season lightly. Add shredded Colby Jack and wrap in low-carb tortillas. \u2022 Dinner: Sausage & Pinto Bean Skillet \u2013 Slice smoked sausage and pan-fry with pinto beans, green beans, and a spoonful of diced tomatoes with green chilis. \u2e3b Tuesday \u2022 Lunch: Celery & Hummus Snack Plate \u2013 Pair celery sticks, bell pepper strips, and jalape\u00f1o slices (optional heat) with a generous serving of hummus. \u2022 Dinner: Enchilada Chicken Bake \u2013 Layer cooked chicken, enchilada sauce, cream cheese, shredded cheese, and diced tomatoes with green chilis in a baking dish. Bake until bubbly. \u2e3b Wednesday \u2022 Lunch: Pinto Bean & Corn Salad Wraps \u2013 Mix canned corn, pinto beans, fresh tomatoes, and bell peppers with light seasoning. Wrap in tortillas. \u2022 Dinner: Smoked Sausage Stir-Fry \u2013 Saut\u00e9 sausage with mixed vegetables and jalape\u00f1os. Serve over jasmine rice. \u2e3b Thursday \u2022 Lunch: Chicken Jalape\u00f1o Roll-Ups \u2013 Mix shredded chicken, cream cheese, jalape\u00f1os, and Colby Jack. Spread on tortillas and roll up. Chill and slice. \u2022 Dinner: Tomato & Bean Rice Bowl \u2013 Cook jasmine rice. Top with pinto beans, diced tomatoes with green chilis, saut\u00e9ed green beans, and sprinkle with cheese. \u2e3b Friday \u2022 Lunch: Low-Carb Sausage Lettuce Tacos (if you have lettuce) \u2013 Or use tortillas. Fill with sausage, corn, and veggies. Top with fresh tomatoes and jalape\u00f1os. \u2022 Dinner: Creamy Chicken Veggie Skillet \u2013 Cook chicken, stir in cream cheese and frozen vegetables. Add Colby Jack for a creamy finish. YMMV and good luck.",

Categories like: Meatless, High Protein, Low Calorie, Low Time Commitment, Salad, Soup, Pasta, Lasts Long Time in Fridge, Assembly Required etc. This is normally the type of stuff I consider when I think about what I want to prepare for the week. It also gives me a good idea if my recipe count is lagging in any area. In addition to categories, I also have ingredients per recipe recorded along with reasonable substitutions. There are times when I have an excess of some kitchen staple or something is expiring and I need to use it soon. So I'll search for that ingredient to quickly figure out what I've used it for in the past. This is also helpful for weeks when you might need to budget a bit more tightly and pull from your staples as much as possible. The hard part of course is building that list. It just takes time. I've used Hellofresh as a way to try new things with little hassle. And sometimes I just find a meal prep series on YouTube and pick one that doesn't seem too hard. Just be sure to carve out time somehow to add to your list.",

      "I\u2019m also quite picky with vegetables. I\u2019ve had some success lately with pickling, either with lemon juice and salt or with rice vinegar rather than white vinegar. Cucumbers and carrots work well for this and I\u2019m planning to try daikon radish and onions eventually. Prior to that my go to would be incorporating them into flavorful dishes like stir fries or soups and stews. Pur\u00e9ed or grated veg in baked goods also works well. Pumpkin pancakes are delicious and I mostly hate pumpkin otherwise. Best of luck with finding some recipes that work for you!",
      "Charred veggies are fabulous. Spinach and kale disappear into smoothies without altering the flavor. Pickled veggies are great but keep an eye on sodium intake.

I could easily eat it on its own as a bisque https://www.vnutritionandwellness.com/cauliflower-alfredo-sauce/",
      "I chop them up very small and cook them into food. I got an electric mincer for my onions, so now they can basically go in my food as onion mush and I never have to worry about biting into onions. I always shred carrots and chop things like celery and peppers extremely thin or small. Yes, it takes a bit longer, but it helps the flavors blend in with the food and I dont get bites of straight up vegetables, which i still just cant get into even as a 30 year old. Some favorites: pasta salad, chicken and gnocchi soup, pot roasts",
      "Since you like cabbage, try thinly shaved brussel sprouts and carrots raw like a slaw. Beets (look for golden or watermelon) raw and super thinly sliced on a spinach salad with aged thick balsamic and strawberries. Cucumber and dill sandwiches. Mashed cauliflower (steam, mash with choice of i.e., plant/traditional butter and milk).",
      "Looks like you eat quite a few veggies!! Make others hidden so you don\u2019t even know they are there. I Hide them in pasta sauce. I grate carrot, mushroom and zucchini, squeeze out the juice, and cook them down for hours with onion, garlic, basil, ground beef and sausage. Add red sauce and literally simmer it for 4-6 hours. The veggies melt away in the sauce and you can\u2019t even tell there is zucchini in it. My husband hates all squash and loves the sauce I make. Add spinach to muffins or pancakes! Makes them green, but doesn\u2019t add flavor really. I do this for my kids and they love it."

      "Start with stuff you know you know you like. You see chuck beef? I see a big batch of braised barbacoa bowls with rice, beans, maybe some fajita veggies. Don\u2019t want barbacoa? Season it differently or cut it into steak bites and serve with potatoes. Also, you don\u2019t always have to make a protein, a carb, and a veggie separately, you can make dishes like pasta (I\u2019m a big drunken noodle fan) with a higher protein proportion then you\u2019d normally get. Plenty of dishes *can* be very macro friendly if you just modify the proportions slightly. So my advice: start with what you like to eat already, and then modify the carb/fat/protein proportions within the dish to make it macro friendly (sounds like you already know what macros you\u2019re aiming for so you\u2019re ahead of the game there). But also don\u2019t forget *micro*nutrients, I made that mistake initially but now I feel a lot better even though my macros aren\u2019t actually any different. Also, stews. If you like chili, make chili, chili rocks",

To meal prep make it a burrito and wait to add avocado when you eat it Lunch a grain bowl or Buddha bowl, cooked barley and lentils makes a filling combo, or edamame instead of lentils.

In my experience, cooking loses roughly 20% water, so if I\u2019m starting off with cooked then it\u2019s 25g/80g cooked. Fats are 100cal/TBS. And that\u2019s a measured tablespoon, not scooping mayo with a dessert spoon.

Fruit & bread or starchy things, you won\u2019t have much wiggle room, if you stick to mostly non starchy veg, then you can eat a lot. Recipes can be modified to fit.

Hope this helps! There's a few users on here who swear by our containers so they might be able to give you their experience as well. TL:DR - High quality steel formatted correctly in smooth rounded surfaces prevents the sparking that is caused by putting metal in the microwave, this comes from arcs that form on sharp or pointed metal edges reflecting microwaves. These have been thoroughly tested on a range of microwaves, but they're also oven-safe if you prefer.",

For me it was a turn off, especially looking back at the price point. These at least stack/nest really nicely but found myself not using them after a couple meals. I also did not notice reduced microwave time, and have separately come to appreciate containers that have compartments since I think food heats up better that way/can pull one ingredient out if it needs more heating.",

      "Regarding item 3: I have gotten a lot of use out of my Souper Cubes. I started with the 1-cup (250 ml) and 2-cup (500 ml) trays. Recently, I added an additional 1-cup. If you only get one tray, I would get the 1-cup. 1-cup is a good size to freeze broth, soup, beans, pasta sauce, curries, cooked rice, mac & cheese, egg breakfast bars. You might need more than one 1-cup cube for a meal but it gives you options. 2-cup is good for cottage pie, pot pie, baked pasta dishes and stews with larger cut ingredients (I underfill because a full 2 cups is too much for the people I feed). You can store the cubes in the trays but it takes up more freezer real estate and ties up the cubes. I think most people transfer to disposable freezer bags (eg Ziploc), reusable bags (eg Oxo 1-gallon Silicone Reusable Bag), or big tub (I have a Lock & Lock 21.1 cup bread box that fits 12 1-cup cubes). You can also vacuum seal the cubes for longer storage. Souper Cube Resources: simplysarahhart on instagram/tiktok has a lot of useful information about freezer meals using Souper Cubes. Lately she's been building what she calls \"lego lunches\" which might be a good option for your husband so he can mix and match. I like that Sarah addresses all parts of the process including the reheat. She also has a Substack with recipes. Meal Plan Addict also has a great post on Easy Ways to Use Souper Cubes and posts on freezer pantry in general. Souper Cubes has a recipe section on their website and a useful social media feed. Things to note: \\---The trays are bulky and do not nest. Given your storage situation, you might want to not transfer until you need the trays to freeze something else effectively storing your trays in your multiple freezers. \\--Since the cubes are frozen when they go into and come out of the bags, the bags are easier to clean and reuse than if unfrozen food went into them. I can keep a ziploc going for quite some time. \\--I don't have a dishwasher and smells can sling to the trays. I have to bake them empty when I want to freshen them up. A friend with a dishwasher doesn't have this issue. \\--You have to put the cubes in something to defrost/reheat. It's not a grab, uncover, and stick in the microwave process like a store bought frozen meal. While not difficult to put the cubes into a bowl, it is an extra step. Would really love an update on how your freezer meals are going once you get in a groove. It's always helpful to see what works and doesn't work for others. Edit: typo",
      "I have been using Souper Cubes for a few years and I love them. I use the 1 cup size which is about 1/4 liter. I make soups, stews, chili etc., pour it into the cubes, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze. Then I remove the frozen \u201cbricks\u201d and put them into a plastic bag to store them. A 1 cup brick is perfect as a single serving. I also have a small size (maybe 3 tablespoons, not sure) which I have used to freeze Ingredients like leftover tomato paste, wine, etc. in small portions that are useful for cooking. Souper Cubes are well made and hold up after many trips through the dishwasher.",
      "I\u2019m in the UK and got a knockoff on Amazon that are the 1 cup ones. It\u2019s hard to say as people have different Appetites but the 1 cup have measurements for 1/2 cup inside them. They\u2019re what I have. I\u2019d suggest next time you do a stew or soup, try measuring so it gives you an idea. 1 cup is about 250ml. I find rule of thumb for me: 2 cups soup, 1 cup stews/chillies (since they\u2019ll be bulked out with rice & salad). I also tend to bulk cook roast veg, which I\u2019ll use the 1/2C line for (like mushrooms & onions combo). Once frozen, I stick in zip freezer bags (currently using IKEA which are strong). When I go to defrost I take them out of the bag & stick in a container. That way the bag stays \u201cclean\u201d (clean enough for me as it\u2019s my frozen food I\u2019m cooking for myself) so I barely need to wash it and I\u2019m using less plastic. The 1 cup blocks are bulky, and I keep thinking I may go to 1/2 cup molds as the shape is easier to freeze (I think), but so far it\u2019s not worth the \u00a3.",
      "i love the souper cubes. I got a 2 cup container for things like soups and casseroles that are 1 serving. Then I got the 1 cup containers for like beans and rice. The 1 cup container also has measurements for 1/2 cup. So you don't really need to get those.",

They take microwave steaming fine, but oils\u2014which get much hotter than water\u2014can scar the plastic if overcooked in the microwave, but they're fine if not overcooked. One of the drawbacks of plastic over glass, but glass is just too thick and heavy for what I want."

      "Wow, I was not expecting such a response from this post. So to respond to a few questions and comments I keep seeing: * This is 1 week's worth of meals (sometimes we cook 6 days worth, sometimes 7), for two people. Yes, they keep just fine for a week. I've been meal prepping weekly or about 2 years and have been prepping ALL of my meals for about a year. Obviously there are certain foods you can't prep because you know they won't last. For example, I would never do anything with avocado in it because it'll be trash in two days. But sushi rice holds up great. * If you're curious, the top shelf is mine. I have 24 meals in there; 6 days worth, 4 meals a day. His is the bottom shelf, he has 18 (3 meals a day). We set each shelf so we could put a 7-meal high stack on each level, and there's still room for 4x 2-meal stacks at the very bottom. I haven't done the math for my roommate's, but my meals run about $3.50/ea to prepare and they're each about 700cal. * There seems to be a lot of, ahem, *discussion* regarding the cost of this to purchase and operate. That's not really the point, but we got this second hand so it was cheap with a warranty. We are aware it's not as efficient as a standard, modern home fridge. Luckily, the compressor barely has to run, and it doesn't need to run for very long to stay cool. I can appreciate the concern of the people in this thread who think this one small mini-fridge (it's like 3/4 the size of an actual fridge, btw) is single-handedly responsible for climate change, but if it sucks on the electric bill, onto OfferUp it goes. Again, not really the point. * The containers are plastic but they are not thrown out every week. They are microwave safe and dishwasher safe. We wash and re-use them every week.",

      "Nice! Chicken breast is a great healthy lunch option. Chicken breast can also get very boring so it\u2019s worth it to do a YouTube deep dive and find new ways to cook it. Rice is always great with chicken breast because it will absorb the flavors of the chicken and whatever sauce you eat with it. Not sure of your food budget, but I highly recommend a rice cooker. Firstly it makes cooking rice way too easy. Secondly it makes the rice taste way better. I don\u2019t know how, but it\u2019s on a whole other level. Also, you\u2019re gonna year brown rice is a healthier option, and while that\u2019s true, it\u2019s also not the most enjoyable to eat. So while you\u2019re on your first steps toward healthy eating, just stick with the white rice if you don\u2019t enjoy brown. Additionally, you can use chicken stock instead of water when making rice which adds more flavor, but chicken stock is also a great way to increase the cost of your food, so I don\u2019t always recommend it. Good first step and don\u2019t feel like you have to stick with anything specific and don\u2019t torture yourself, if you ate a home cooked meal every day this week and you really want Popeyes on Friday, go for it. Small steps and gradual change will lead you to success. All or nothing always leads to nothing eventually. If next week comes around and you don\u2019t make any meals at home who cares, just make it a goal to do better the week after. It\u2019s gonna take like three months until you really figure out what you like to cook and eat at home. So just go with the flow and figure out where you would like to be with all of this come January first.",
      "Not bad but I would definitely suggest replacing that egg roll, I assume is what that is lol, with white or even better, brown rice for your carb intake. It\u2019s extremely easy to make and not processed as compared to the egg roll. On top of that, I\u2019ve always found steaming broccoli and/or corn and spicing it up with some seasoning is a fantastic choice for a side. I hate most veggies but it\u2019s amazing what a dab of sriracha can do lol",
      "Great job! But just a word of advice, frozen meals are usually higher in sodium. Granted I use frozen meals for the vegetables, just watch out for the spring roll and chicken. The Tyson chicken shouldn\u2019t be too bad but the spring roll isn\u2019t the best. BUT, you\u2019re also starting out so it\u2019s good to still keep similar stuff that you\u2019re used to eating when you order food, because if you try to completely change your diet 180 degrees then it\u2019ll be too hard and you\u2019ll give up. Also, the crockpot and instant pot will be your best friend! If you have time to run to the grocery store, that\u2019s all you need. Throw some pork shoulder in there before you go to bed or before you leave for work, come back 8 hours later to perfect pulled pork. Chili, chicken, rice, anything can be done in those things! Just google some recipes",
      "That\u2019s amazing! Good for you and your appreciation for your health. You\u2019re going to start feeling so good. I don\u2019t even know you and I\u2019m happy for you.

Sorry I don\u2019t have exact amounts, it\u2019s worth experimenting with the broth before making a bunch or jars to make sure you like it. For the broth: Better than bouillon roasted chicken soup base (tablespoon or so) Fish sauce (only a couple dashes here, a little goes a long way) Soy sauce ( a few dashes) Thai chili garlic sauce (few teaspoons ?) Red curry paste (tablespoon ish) Canned tiny shrimp (hear me out on this one, they basically disintegrate but that\u2019s a god thing because they give the broth a nice briny body that it would have otherwise) Rice noodles (par cooked) Tofu (extra firm and pressed for 10 minutes) Minced ginger Cilantro Green onion Lime",

The only time she had morphine was the last 2 days before she died, and only because she was so bad she could no longer communicate if she was in pain) A couple drops of cbd oil down the straw of her morning coffee would make sure she got the full dosage.

But to a Louisiana-born person like myself, what you have there is really more like rice with red beans as opposed to \u201cred beans and rice\u201d Here\u2019s my recipe. It\u2019s hard to mess up. Qty. | Ingredient -----|------ 1 lb | Red kidney beans 1 lb | Andouille or smoked pork sausage (sliced into 1/4\" - 1/2\u201d thick Rounds) 8-10 Cups | Water \u00bd lb | Bacon (whole slices, thick cut works best) 1 | Onion (diced) 1-2 clove | Garlic (minced) 1 stalk | Celery (chopped) 2 Tbsp | Parsley (chopped) 2-3 | large Bay Leaves - | Black Pepper to taste >Rinse and sort the beans in a large bowl (optionally you can soak them overnight). In a large pot or Dutch oven begin browning the sausage on mid-high heat. As enough fat renders out, add celery and onions, cooking on medium heat until the onions are translucent, just as they start to carmelize. Add the garlic, bacon and bay leaf and cook for 30-60 seconds until the garlic is fragrant. Add water and beans, then turn the heat to low after the water just comes to boil. Cover and simmer approximately 4-6 hrs. Stir every 15 minutes or so to prevent sticking. Towards the end of the cook, remove the long stringy bits of remaining bacon and add the parsley, then smash about 1/4 to 1/3rd of the beans against the side of the pot with the back of a spoon, this helps to thicken and create the \u201cgravy\u201d. When the consistency is to your liking, shut off the heat, spoon over a bowl of long grain rice and garnish with sliced green onion. Serve with hot French bread or cornbread for maximum satisfaction. This will last 2 people probably 4-6 meals each depending on how big your servings are. And it\u2019s even better on day 2 and 3. Edit: Fixed table formatting",

      "I really commend the effort, and the forethought that went into this. But have you researched if the food will retain its nutritional value? A lot of holistic medical practices ask you to eat fresh to avoid a host of issues. And as a mother who would probably be breastfeeding the new baby, you would want to get as many nutrients as possible. Now I completely understand having a new baby puts a whole lot of strain on new parents, but I would rather compromise on other things that fresh food. I do understand that its impossible to make fresh food every time, but salads and sandwiches are fairly quick compared to the nutritional value they offer. Also I say this because ever since I put in the effort to eat fresh, I have seen a marked improvement with my cluster headaches, gastric issues. So I have experienced the benefits first hand.",

      "/u/basenjifart Omg I am feeling for you right now. I grew up with a very large garden/very small farm, so we would process and prep food for the rest of the year during the summer. Everything from peas and pumpkins to pies and apple sauce. First, UPRIGHT FREEZER. Seriously, adjust your goals because an upright freezer gives you more/better visibility of what you\u2019ve got. A chest freezer is less expensive, but an upright is so freaking nice. Containers: Rubbermaid. I do smaller and larger (ie, 5 cup+ size) containers). Yes, plastic, but... they last longer than anything else and are the most efficient in the freezer (stacking). Get the best, most solid containers you can afford, even if you just buy a few each year. Glass will break if contents expand, or if, god forbid, you drop it. Plastic, if thin (think: dollar store thin plastic freezer containers) will chip as well, but if you get something heavy duty at worst it will stain. Obviously double check that it\u2019s bpa free; but most is these days. Is storing in plastic ideal? No, but of all the materials I\u2019ve tried, it has the most longevity. Experience: 40+ years of living like this! Pro tip - make sure your kids are heavy duty, NO vented lids. I use the Rubbermaid stackable lids and containers. Thicker = less likely to warp. Wash on the top rack of the dishwasher for longevity, and get yourself a cute basket to throw your clean freezer containers in to keep them separate.",
      "Like someone mentioned, vacuum seal. At first, I thought foodsaver was a gimmick. But now, I have had mine for over 4 years. And use it quite often. I almost vacuum pack everything. My family too has a hectic schedule due to my kids being competitive athletes. I vacuum pack single serve meals, bulk meals, milk, eggs, single side serving, etc. Everything goes in our chest freezer. We buy in bulk and save money and time. We even use the Mason jar vacuum attachment to prolong the life of dry goods like dried beans, spaghetti, and much more. It just works. Best of luck.",
      "If it makes you feel any better I lost this arguement with a friend of mine. She'd made a whole bunch of this special Yoga tea and went to put it in the freezer. \"Can't do that.\" \"Why not?\" \"Because of the water. When it freezes it'll expand and break the glass.\" \"But Sanjeet does it all the time!\" \"....maybe Yoga tea takes on some special properties that are unlike the usual freezing properties water that I'm not aware of, but if growing up in the Northeast has taught me anything, water expands.\" She gave me that \"you must be wrong because my yoga friends know best\" look and shoved it in the freezer. This woman has her master's, is a teacher, and knows the power of Google. It's been 7 years. Whenever I'm positive of something and she thinks I'm crazy I still bring this up.",
      "Honestly, wide-mouth jars are superior anyway. They're WAY easier to clean. I'm sure you've already ruined that food, but I would have left it frozen until you had another container to let it thaw into. Jars with true shattering would need to be removed around the frozen food before thawing, but the any with simple line fractures (like the middle one) can be safely thawed in the jar without worrying about glass in your food. Aka all of that food is salvageable, despite your live-and-learn situation there.",
      "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss, I\u2019d be so sad! Freezer prep is my August jam as well. Like you, I freeze a boatload of tomato sauce, chili, and curry. My other fave trick is to roast a whole turkey (or two chickens) and turn the meat into 2-3 meals of each of pot pie filling, \u201cchicken\u201d and dumplings, \u201cchicken\u201d tortilla soup, and green chile \u201cchicken\u201d enchilada filling. This year the urge to stock up hit in July. I had ten meals X3 packed away already, meant to cover 10 weeknights a month for three months: from school starting mid-August through American Thanksgiving in late November. But it didn\u2019t quite work out that way, because my husband had an accident on August 6 and life was pretty crazy for a few weeks. I messed up my original meal plan, but we had dinners during that time! I hope it\u2019s not too hard to replace what you\u2019ve lost there.

      "I\u2019ve been using Chat GPT to help with my meal planning the past month or so. I put in what style of cuisine I want to eat for the next two weeks, i.e.; Asian, Comfort Food, Mexican, etc., what type of proteins to use, and have it generate not only a list of recipes, but also put those recipes into a rotation where I never eat the same thing twice in a row. I meal prep for both lunch and dinner, so this is definitely a bonus. I also have it adapt the recipes to my instant pot and slow cooker, which makes clean up a breeze. Here is a sample of what I\u2019ve input and received for the next two weeks, and the recipe rotation. My input: Make a rotating recipe list for lunch and dinner the next two weeks using these ingredients: Boneless chicken breasts Smoked beef sausage Cream cheese Shredded Colby Jack Frozen mixed vegetables Pinto beans Canned whole kernel corn Green beans Diced tomatoes with green chilis Hummus Low carb tortillas Fresh diced tomatoes Bell pepper strips Celery sticks Fresh jalape\u00f1o\u2019s Enchilada sauce Jasmine rice ChatGPT results: Here\u2019s a 2-week rotating recipe plan for lunch and dinner using the ingredients you listed. Each meal is diabetic-friendly, balanced, and makes the most of your pantry and freezer without needing extra shopping. \u2e3b WEEK 1 Monday \u2022 Lunch: Chicken Veggie Wraps \u2013 Saut\u00e9 diced chicken, frozen mixed vegetables, and bell pepper strips. Season lightly. Add shredded Colby Jack and wrap in low-carb tortillas. \u2022 Dinner: Sausage & Pinto Bean Skillet \u2013 Slice smoked sausage and pan-fry with pinto beans, green beans, and a spoonful of diced tomatoes with green chilis. \u2e3b Tuesday \u2022 Lunch: Celery & Hummus Snack Plate \u2013 Pair celery sticks, bell pepper strips, and jalape\u00f1o slices (optional heat) with a generous serving of hummus. \u2022 Dinner: Enchilada Chicken Bake \u2013 Layer cooked chicken, enchilada sauce, cream cheese, shredded cheese, and diced tomatoes with green chilis in a baking dish. Bake until bubbly. \u2e3b Wednesday \u2022 Lunch: Pinto Bean & Corn Salad Wraps \u2013 Mix canned corn, pinto beans, fresh tomatoes, and bell peppers with light seasoning. Wrap in tortillas. \u2022 Dinner: Smoked Sausage Stir-Fry \u2013 Saut\u00e9 sausage with mixed vegetables and jalape\u00f1os. Serve over jasmine rice. \u2e3b Thursday \u2022 Lunch: Chicken Jalape\u00f1o Roll-Ups \u2013 Mix shredded chicken, cream cheese, jalape\u00f1os, and Colby Jack. Spread on tortillas and roll up. Chill and slice. \u2022 Dinner: Tomato & Bean Rice Bowl \u2013 Cook jasmine rice. Top with pinto beans, diced tomatoes with green chilis, saut\u00e9ed green beans, and sprinkle with cheese. \u2e3b Friday \u2022 Lunch: Low-Carb Sausage Lettuce Tacos (if you have lettuce) \u2013 Or use tortillas. Fill with sausage, corn, and veggies. Top with fresh tomatoes and jalape\u00f1os. \u2022 Dinner: Creamy Chicken Veggie Skillet \u2013 Cook chicken, stir in cream cheese and frozen vegetables. Add Colby Jack for a creamy finish. YMMV and good luck.",
      "I like to pick 1 soup, 1 casserole/rice dish, 2 proteins (that I either make a salad of heat up canned veggies with), and a pasta sauce of some kind.

Categories like: Meatless, High Protein, Low Calorie, Low Time Commitment, Salad, Soup, Pasta, Lasts Long Time in Fridge, Assembly Required etc. This is normally the type of stuff I consider when I think about what I want to prepare for the week. It also gives me a good idea if my recipe count is lagging in any area. In addition to categories, I also have ingredients per recipe recorded along with reasonable substitutions. There are times when I have an excess of some kitchen staple or something is expiring and I need to use it soon. So I'll search for that ingredient to quickly figure out what I've used it for in the past. This is also helpful for weeks when you might need to budget a bit more tightly and pull from your staples as much as possible. The hard part of course is building that list. It just takes time. I've used Hellofresh as a way to try new things with little hassle. And sometimes I just find a meal prep series on YouTube and pick one that doesn't seem too hard. Just be sure to carve out time somehow to add to your list.",

That way by the time baby shows up your freezer will be full with a variety of options for the first couple of weeks to get you started.

      "Start with stuff you know you know you like. You see chuck beef? I see a big batch of braised barbacoa bowls with rice, beans, maybe some fajita veggies. Don\u2019t want barbacoa? Season it differently or cut it into steak bites and serve with potatoes. Also, you don\u2019t always have to make a protein, a carb, and a veggie separately, you can make dishes like pasta (I\u2019m a big drunken noodle fan) with a higher protein proportion then you\u2019d normally get. Plenty of dishes *can* be very macro friendly if you just modify the proportions slightly. So my advice: start with what you like to eat already, and then modify the carb/fat/protein proportions within the dish to make it macro friendly (sounds like you already know what macros you\u2019re aiming for so you\u2019re ahead of the game there). But also don\u2019t forget *micro*nutrients, I made that mistake initially but now I feel a lot better even though my macros aren\u2019t actually any different. Also, stews. If you like chili, make chili, chili rocks",
      "Ok so for meal prep figure 500 cal breakfast, 500 cal lunch, 700 cal dinner and 200 for a snack Cronometer is great, gives full nutrition not just macros- fiber is important to feel full So if you do eggs for breakfast use Cronometer and try three eggs with spinach and mushrooms and whole grain toast , add avocado if you\u2019re shy on fats. To meal prep make it a burrito and wait to add avocado when you eat it Lunch a grain bowl or Buddha bowl, cooked barley and lentils makes a filling combo, or edamame instead of lentils. Add veggies like some shredded cabbsge or radishes and cucumber whatever sounds good. Some chopped walnuts and vinaigrette",

I take notes throughout the week on what I like, dont like, substitutes, if meals end up being more days (too many leftovers), etc and we rebuild the next week.

Once you know that, if you\u2019re eating meat then I (personally) just assume 25gp/100g raw. In my experience, cooking loses roughly 20% water, so if I\u2019m starting off with cooked then it\u2019s 25g/80g cooked. Fats are 100cal/TBS.

Fruit & bread or starchy things, you won\u2019t have much wiggle room, if you stick to mostly non starchy veg, then you can eat a lot. Recipes can be modified to fit.

You can find plenty of reviews on our website from customers who've used our containers in the microwave [here](https://blackblum.com/products/meal-prep-box-set-x5) but if you want a scientific explanation someone has made a youtube video about this topic [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fljZ_jaUq-c) or our own blog that covers the subject [here](https://blog.black-blum.com/2023/03/24/can-you-put-metal-in-the-microwave-3/). Hope this helps! There's a few users on here who swear by our containers so they might be able to give you their experience as well. TL:DR - High quality steel formatted correctly in smooth rounded surfaces prevents the sparking that is caused by putting metal in the microwave, this comes from arcs that form on sharp or pointed metal edges reflecting microwaves. These have been thoroughly tested on a range of microwaves, but they're also oven-safe if you prefer.",

I wanted something lighter than the glass anchor containers I typically use. But I didn't take into account how hot the metal would get and how trying to grab the hot container to pull the lid off would prove on the more difficult side. For me it was a turn off, especially looking back at the price point. These at least stack/nest really nicely but found myself not using them after a couple meals. I also did not notice reduced microwave time, and have separately come to appreciate containers that have compartments since I think food heats up better that way/can pull one ingredient out if it needs more heating.",

      "Regarding item 3: I have gotten a lot of use out of my Souper Cubes. I started with the 1-cup (250 ml) and 2-cup (500 ml) trays. Recently, I added an additional 1-cup. If you only get one tray, I would get the 1-cup. 1-cup is a good size to freeze broth, soup, beans, pasta sauce, curries, cooked rice, mac & cheese, egg breakfast bars. You might need more than one 1-cup cube for a meal but it gives you options. 2-cup is good for cottage pie, pot pie, baked pasta dishes and stews with larger cut ingredients (I underfill because a full 2 cups is too much for the people I feed). You can store the cubes in the trays but it takes up more freezer real estate and ties up the cubes. I think most people transfer to disposable freezer bags (eg Ziploc), reusable bags (eg Oxo 1-gallon Silicone Reusable Bag), or big tub (I have a Lock & Lock 21.1 cup bread box that fits 12 1-cup cubes). You can also vacuum seal the cubes for longer storage. Souper Cube Resources: simplysarahhart on instagram/tiktok has a lot of useful information about freezer meals using Souper Cubes. Lately she's been building what she calls \"lego lunches\" which might be a good option for your husband so he can mix and match. I like that Sarah addresses all parts of the process including the reheat. She also has a Substack with recipes. Meal Plan Addict also has a great post on Easy Ways to Use Souper Cubes and posts on freezer pantry in general. Souper Cubes has a recipe section on their website and a useful social media feed. Things to note: \\---The trays are bulky and do not nest. Given your storage situation, you might want to not transfer until you need the trays to freeze something else effectively storing your trays in your multiple freezers. \\--Since the cubes are frozen when they go into and come out of the bags, the bags are easier to clean and reuse than if unfrozen food went into them. I can keep a ziploc going for quite some time. \\--I don't have a dishwasher and smells can sling to the trays. I have to bake them empty when I want to freshen them up. A friend with a dishwasher doesn't have this issue. \\--You have to put the cubes in something to defrost/reheat. It's not a grab, uncover, and stick in the microwave process like a store bought frozen meal. While not difficult to put the cubes into a bowl, it is an extra step. Would really love an update on how your freezer meals are going once you get in a groove. It's always helpful to see what works and doesn't work for others. Edit: typo",
      "I have been using Souper Cubes for a few years and I love them. I use the 1 cup size which is about 1/4 liter. I make soups, stews, chili etc., pour it into the cubes, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze. Then I remove the frozen \u201cbricks\u201d and put them into a plastic bag to store them. A 1 cup brick is perfect as a single serving. I also have a small size (maybe 3 tablespoons, not sure) which I have used to freeze Ingredients like leftover tomato paste, wine, etc. in small portions that are useful for cooking. Souper Cubes are well made and hold up after many trips through the dishwasher.",
      "I\u2019m in the UK and got a knockoff on Amazon that are the 1 cup ones. It\u2019s hard to say as people have different Appetites but the 1 cup have measurements for 1/2 cup inside them. They\u2019re what I have. I\u2019d suggest next time you do a stew or soup, try measuring so it gives you an idea. 1 cup is about 250ml. I find rule of thumb for me: 2 cups soup, 1 cup stews/chillies (since they\u2019ll be bulked out with rice & salad). I also tend to bulk cook roast veg, which I\u2019ll use the 1/2C line for (like mushrooms & onions combo). Once frozen, I stick in zip freezer bags (currently using IKEA which are strong). When I go to defrost I take them out of the bag & stick in a container. That way the bag stays \u201cclean\u201d (clean enough for me as it\u2019s my frozen food I\u2019m cooking for myself) so I barely need to wash it and I\u2019m using less plastic. The 1 cup blocks are bulky, and I keep thinking I may go to 1/2 cup molds as the shape is easier to freeze (I think), but so far it\u2019s not worth the \u00a3.",
      "i love the souper cubes. I got a 2 cup container for things like soups and casseroles that are 1 serving. Then I got the 1 cup containers for like beans and rice. The 1 cup container also has measurements for 1/2 cup. So you don't really need to get those.",
      "I love [these Snapware 3-cup containers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L4ZY64S) I bought to take lunch to work. They hold 2 \u2013 3 cups easily, they never leak, and they're smol. They are the thinnest/shortest containers I could find for fitting in my bag easily. They take microwave steaming fine, but oils\u2014which get much hotter than water\u2014can scar the plastic if overcooked in the microwave, but they're fine if not overcooked. One of the drawbacks of plastic over glass, but glass is just too thick and heavy for what I want."

      "Do not go on TRT immedietly. That should be a last resort because once you go on it there is no going back, as your body will shut down its natural testosterone production. You should try Tongkat Ali and Cistanche first. Both boost testosterone, and both have adaptogenic properties; meaning they can help with stress and typically anxiety as well. Try them one at a time, and you should add in 5mg of Pregnenolone as well. You could also try Shilajit (be careful a lot are fake), Ashwagandha (cycle it), DHEA, Zinc, and/or Boron. Tonkgat+Cistanche+Shilajit+DHEA+Pregnenolone is a very potent stack that all pair very well with eachother. Furthermore, if you do take Vitamin D3, it's best to take it with K2 and for most with Magnesium as well. You shouldn't just take D3 on its own. Make sure you're also eating healthy and getting enough vitamins and minerals. Taking a B-Complex could be beneficial. Additionally, for trauma Polygala is typically a game changer for most. It's best taken at 100mg dosed 3 times throughout the day, for a total of 300mg, but you can just do 50-300mg dosed once in the day if you wanted to. You could also try Gotu Kola, an incredibly potent anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) herb; Holy Basil, a very calming herb that can help with anxiety, plus it is an \"adaptogen\", so it can help with stress; Sarcosine, a chemical already found in the body with natural antidepressant effects; or Saffron, a very potent mood booster with antidepression and anti-anxiety properties. If budget isn't as much of an issue, or you're just going to take 1-3 things or so, SAM-e could potentially be of great use too, which like Sarcosine is already found in the body. If your SAM-e levels are low, you're not going to be able to cope with stress very well at all. It is also a mood booster, can improve cognition, anti-anxiety, may boost energy, and can do other various things potentially as well. I'm currently taking it and it helps, but it's like ~50/50 whether it works for someone or not.",
      "Hey man, really sorry to hear what you're going through \u2014 that's a massive drop in testosterone and the symptoms you're describing definitely line up with what a lot of people report when their T levels tank. Chronic fatigue, depersonalization, looping thoughts \u2014 it's brutal, and low vitamin D doesn\u2019t help either since it's tied to hormone function and mental clarity. You might want to look into natural support while you wait for further testing. I was in a similar place (low energy, brain fog, poor recovery from stress), and what helped me was focusing on **natural testosterone support** \u2014 not just physically, but for mental balance too. Two supplements that stood out for me were **Tongkat Ali** and **Turkesterone**. There\u2019s a UK-based brand I found called [**Vegishake.co.uk**](https://www.vegishake.co.uk/shop/) \u2014 they do clean, no-filler **organic supplements** and their [**Tongkat Ali capsules**](https://www.vegishake.co.uk/shop/) are specifically aimed at supporting **testosterone levels**, energy, and recovery. They also stock **Turkesterone**, which a lot of guys in fitness and mental wellness communities are turning to as a natural anabolic and adaptogen for **hormonal balance** and **performance** without synthetic hormones. Might be worth looking into while you wait on your cortisol and thyroid tests \u2014 supporting your body naturally while you figure things out medically can sometimes give that extra edge. Sending strength, hope you find answers and start feeling like yourself again soon.",
      "Also just to add \u2014 your **vitamin D levels at 28** are really low and could absolutely be playing a role in how you\u2019re feeling, especially when it comes to **fatigue, mood, immune function**, and even **hormonal balance** like testosterone. I\u2019d recommend checking out [**Vegishake\u2019s high-strength Vitamin D3 supplement**](https://www.vegishake.co.uk/product/vitamin-d3-51000-iu-capsule/) \u2014 it\u2019s a **massive 51,000 IU per capsule**, so you only need to take **one capsule per week**, which is way easier to manage than daily dosing. A lot of people don\u2019t realise how important proper dosing is when recovering from deficiency. But \u2014 and this is important \u2014 it\u2019s best to **take Vitamin D3 with Vitamin K2** to help direct calcium properly into the bones and prevent build-up in the arteries. You can either pair the D3 with Vegishake\u2019s [**Vitamin K2 MK-7**](https://www.vegishake.co.uk/product/vitamin-k2-mk7/), or just go for their [**combined D3 + K2 formula**](https://www.vegishake.co.uk/product/vitamin-d3-and-k2-mk7-capsules/), which makes things easier if you want an all-in-one option. I found it helpful not just for physical health, but also to support **mental clarity and stress resilience**, especially while addressing trauma and low T. Hope this helps in some way.",
      "Very sorry about your trauma Hopefully you are also seeing a professional to talk through the trauma and heal. You did not say how old you are but 297 is extremely low Testosterone levels even for someone my age at 68 I am on testosterone therapy with a Dr and my levels are in the 900 range. A good vitamin D supplement should help with your vitamin D levels. Diet and excercise are also beneficial Best of luck to you.",
      "Looping thoughts sounds like pure OCD to me. I believe OCD is part of the reason I had low T, because I couldn't sleep anymore with all the anxiety it was causing me. I tried everything naturally to fix my sleep and raise my T, but nothing worked. It even got worse because I was overtraining on basically no sleep. I was taking sleeping pills every night, and feeling like a damn zombie. Finally convinced my doc to put me on TRT. It fixed almost everything, my sleep is very good now, good energy. I still have OCD and looping thoughts, but now I have energy and motivation to deal with it and to learn to live with it. TRT could be a solution for you, ask your doc. Good luck and don't give up, being low T with no sleep was the worst part of my life, but it does get better."

I used to take too much vitamin D for about a year or slightly less due to my deficiency but then had chronic inflammation and severe breathlessness which was due to retinol depletion which thus decreased ceruloplasmine (retinol dependent protein for copper bioavailability) and decreased copper utilization and bioavailability which caused a lot of other bad symptoms.

      "For me it varies from one product to the next, although most of the time I am looking at bang for buck, yet sometimes I want \"no filler, premium option. Thorne is the brand when you want \"the best\" or at least no fillers. Pure Encapsulations is similar to Thorne, another top-tier brand. Swanson is where I buy when sampling something I never tried before, most of the time but now always. They have little bottles of full spectrum herbs cheaper than anyone else. And they have most, but not all hers in capsules. Swanson is one of the cheapest brands, but they have been around for a very long time. You see them on amazon ebay iherb and all thes rest, too, but at a marked up price compared to guying direct from them. Double Wood has the best deals on Magnesium (unless you must have No-filler, then Thorne or possibly Pure Encapsulations) NOW is well known and trust with most people, and I have some of their stuff, no problems from them so far. NusaPure for Jiaogulan and Cordyceps, or anytime you want a large bottle of high potency for the least amount but with at least medium confidence). Walmart/Spring Valley for anything they have that I get elsewhere simply because walmart is convenient and almost always is as cheap or cheaper than other brands, the quality has been fine, no issues so far. Best Naturals is a good bang for buck (3rd party tested it says on some of their stuff) Bronson is a cheap one that's been good at least the Milk Thistle was, helped my liver. I got some K2 from them as well. Nutricost for Taurine and when I want to bulk purchase something for stocking up on the cheap, but is not the best in some cases people said it was bunk. I think everything I got from them so far has been ok though, but some I haven't tried it yet. Jacked Factory for Yohimbine, Carnitine, and that kinda stuff. SolarRay has a really get reputation, and is a nice mid tier/premium brand when you are trying to find something that isn't easy to get a good one of it in the cheaper brands. I like their Cal/Mag/Zinc, although I don't take it too often these days but it's possibly the best Calcium supplement for myself when i do want it. DEAL is a really cheap brand I have tried, hit or miss from one product to the next but some are good, like their R-Alpha Lipoic Acid, Alpha GPC both seemed legit when I tried them. NatureBell is similar to DEAl, it's a new bargain basement brand. But they jacked up some prices on some things since they are having some success. I probably have more Swanson bottle than anything else.",

      "Awesome results which provides awesome conclusions. The fact that only 20 mins a day of sun exposure can give significant vitamin D. Even with clothes just spend more time out there. Thanks!",
      "Thank you for sharing this. I am surprised you have not made some more research before this. 2 years is a lot of time to invest, spend it wisely. And safety first. The first thing is UVB rays. You may read it on meteo weather reports, as UV index. Then you can also measure the sun angle which allows for the UVB to go through the atmosphere. The angle should be 50 \u00b0 or more. That is when your shadow is shorter than your height. So, spending time to be in the open in the morning is relative success. Also find out about the angle and calendar, or what time of year it is. Summer is different from winter, very much. The second thing is skin protection. Aim to get the UVB exposure enough, but not too much to make unnecessary skin damage. You just want UVB radiation sun beams enough to make vitamin D, protect your skin for the rest of the time you are exposed. Research shows 10 to 15 minutes under that 50 \u00b0 condition is enough. You may find the exact sun angle for each day of the year in your earth coordinates with many free sites and apps on the internet. I am supposing you are Caucasian, people with more melatonin in the skin require some more time to achieve the same result in the same coordinates.",
      "Thank you for sharing your results! I think this is fascinating. Unless I wear a lot of sunblock on my full body, I don\u2019t know if I could do 20 minutes in the sun. I am very white and have lots of freckles. However, I find this fascinating stuff.",

      "Here\u2019s a write up that I did recently for r/shootmorecum: I\u2019ve analyzed all of the big brands and taken most of them. I\u2019ve also experimented with my own stacks over the years. Here are my notes in order of preference: - Load Boost. Great formulation, 3rd party tested. Overall my favorite by far. I like that it includes copper. Outside of a custom stack, this is your best bet. - Lock and Load gets 2nd. Formulation is good, but it has a couple ingredients that I won\u2019t touch in high doses for safety reasons (Selenium and Vitamin E). No copper is worrying with this much zinc. Also has a couple of unnecessary ingredients (Vitamin D and Nitrosigine). 3rd party tested which is good. - Popstarlabs. Might be a good formula but it\u2019s a proprietary blend so no clue what\u2019s actually in it. Probably underdosed - I noticed results but had better luck with LB and L&L. Also the lack of copper is worrying when macro dosing zinc. - Absolute junk: Ultraload. Major Load. Thunder Loads. Ball Refill. Anything brand under Leading Edge Health (Semenax, Volume Pills, Max Load, VigRX, etc.). These companies are all janky and located in India and have terrible formulations. Lmk if there another one you\u2019re curious about. I\u2019ve probably tried it, including tests where I have narrowed down individual ingredients and dosages. I\u2019ve spent years researching this lol. TL;DR Load Boost wins. Lock & Load is decent. The rest aren\u2019t worth trying. Making your own stack will always be the best option from a price standpoint, though it\u2019s a bitch and you have to make sure each brand that you\u2019re sourcing is clean. I tend to prefer to go with companies like VB and gorilla mind because I know they source high quality ingredients, though I do find myself trying out new custom stacks every couple years",

I do have a very high libido to begin with and it's increasing over time, yay, but this stack really effects it. &#x200B; **However!!** &#x200B; There are two things not/and listed here that, with no real side effects and generally helping me even more than the supplements! &#x200B; ***Water and Edging*** &#x200B; Drink loads of water (safe amount), and edge a few times before cumming, or even go a day or two of actively edging and then unload. Same rough effects as the supplements (less reliable, yes, but sometimes better results even! and ohmygod my arousal levels) but without the side effects. &#x200B; Don't go insane and over-hyrdate or stop cumming for a year or two or something ridiculous, but yeah.

      "I first noticed this on Instagram. OneADay Vitamins, a brand I previously trusted, listed a Stress Formula which included this, on Instagram. But it was nowhere to be found on their website. That made me suspicious. Now this post. I had no idea what this was, so I looked it up. Yes. This started appearing everywhere like dandelion weeds in spring. Native to Africa & India, Withania Somnifera AKA Ashwagandha is Sanskrit for \"smell of the horse\" according to a Healthline article I found because of its odor & alleged ability to increase strength. Its use was by Ayurvedic and Naturopathic practitioners but generally in combination with other herbs, not alone. Of the nine potential benefits, research studies are based on small samples less than 80. There are reported benefits for improved sperm quality, sports activity tolerance. Reduced blood sugar in diabetes, improved HgbA1C was found in five clinical studies with the caveat better designed studies are needed. WebMD listed improved stress tolerance cited in five studies. One study found It may soothe Rheumatoid Arthritis. Animal studies also show it reduced inflammation,and has shown to limit neurodegenerative disease and cancer. When I see a lack of replicated studies, nothing conclusive or absolute and everything pointing to the need for future research, I get not just skeptical but irritated. When all recommendations point to \"may help but\" this is not something I would trust. Now all of that said, companies get away with this because it is an herb, a food supplement, which are typically not well researched with the exception of a few probiotics. \"Ashwagandha is possibly safe when used for up to 3 months. The long-term safety of ashwagandha is not known. Large doses of ashwagandha might cause stomach upset, diarrhea, and vomiting. Rarely, liver problems, including severe liver failure and a need for liver transplantation, might occur.\" (Per WebMD). Add variability in dosages in these studies, interactions with meds that lower blood sugar blood, blood pressure, immunity, increased sleepiness. The bottom line gets to be this is another new trend, a bandwagon albeit a promising one companies are jumping on without sufficient sound documentation. https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ashwagandha https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/ashwagandha",
      "In Ayurvedic medicine where it originated from, it is considered a \"heating\" herb, so yeah, for some people who already run hot or have inflammation, sometimes it can exacerbate an already \"hot\" body, its really only good for people who need an adaptogen who run on the \"cooler\" side of the body temperature scale, and even then, if you're taking too much of it then yeah, too much of a good thing",

I've never had anything clear up my issue I was having. This did. However, I have an autoimmune problem. Within a week of taking ashwaganda, I had a flare-up and had horrible pain. I discontinued knowing it could occur. I waited and tried again. Then, a third time. All the same issues.

      "You forgot to mention all the petroleum-based fertilizers and other dangerous chemicals sprayed all over our food. Storytime: During World War 2, there was a huge petroleum industry in America. We supplied most of the petroleum products to the Allies. Then, the war ended and, suddenly, we didn't need all the petroleum products it generated for the war effort anymore. But lots of money was spent building up this infrastructure, so some clever people got together and found a way to turn oil into fertilizer so they could keep the industry running. They discovered these petroleum-based fertilizers they had concocted made plants ripen faster and look better for display, and farmers didn't have to rotate their crops as often. The only problem, discovered later but not really broadcast to the general public, was that plants grown with these fertilizers mature too quickly, which means they don't absorb all the nutrients (including, among other things, magnesium) that a plant grown with traditional farming methods would. They also fail to develop several amino acids humans need to consume to be healthy, as we can't make them ourselves. Incidentally, this is around the time we started seeing a rise in maladies such as attention deficit disorders, autism-spectrum disorders, Alzheimer disease and Parkinson's disease. While there might not be any proof these events are causally linked, there is *evidence*, and in any case, there's no proof they're not, either. And to the people saying that doctors just began *noticing* these disorders more frequently post WW2 but that they had always been there, I say there's no proof of that, either. Correlation does not equal causation. So, decide for yourself, I guess. Roundup, on the other hand, started its life as a descaling agent for water tanks. The scientist working on it discovered it killed all the plants wherever he poured it out, and hey presto, suddenly this scientist's company had a new herbicide. Just in time, too, since DDT had recently been banned, costing this particular company's revenue to decline rather sharply. Then, after observing that certain bacteria didn't seem to notice when they were soaked with this stuff, they started splicing genes from these bacteria into crop cultivars to make them resistant to their very lucrative herbicide so they could just douse an entire field with a crop duster instead of hiring individuals to walk through the fields spraying weeds one at a time. They added surfactants to it so it would soak into the plants' cells better, enhancing the desiccant effect, thereby killing weeds more efficiently. This meant they would have to spray crops less frequently, though they would still have to do multiple applications per season, since rain would eventually wash most of it away into the soil. After studying its desiccant properties more closely, one company began encouraging farmers to use Roundup to dry crops so they wouldn't get moldy in storage. But this drying application is done after harvest, so there's no more rain to wash it off. Oats, it turns out, as well as wheat, are particularly good at retaining Roundup after this drying treatment. To sum up, in an effort to keep a wartime-scale industry charging ahead after the war ended, a way was found for its products and byproducts to feed plants and make them pretty instead of healthy, creating a world-wide nutrition desert, and a chemical devised with the intent of removing lime scale from water containers switched careers and is now sprayed on almost every bite of food you eat. Almost all processed foods have remnants, often in significant amounts, and almost all your produce, whether it's organic or not, is tainted with these poisons. I dare anyone to convince me with *facts* that this chemical bombardment of our food supply doesn't have any deleterious effects on human wellbeing. Studies funded by the manufacturers of these products do not count. And if you want to know which company I've been alluding to above, just look up DDT. (Hint: it's the same company that brought us the miracle of Agent Orange.) Have a nice day! (Edited for punctuation)"

      "Thank you so much for this, such a bright and valuable guide! Yesterday I received my blood test results and I'm severly lacking Vitamin D (8.2 ng/ml). I used [this website](https://www.grassrootshealth.net/project/dcalculator/) to calculate how much supplements I need, which recommends 25000 UI for 9 days then 7000 UI. One quick question if I may: I don't know if I'm currently lacking Magnesium, but with such a high input of Vitamin D to come, I assume I will have to take Magnesium supplements as well. How do you recommend going about it? Do I start both intake (D & Magnesium) on the same day? Also, I would have liked to take one before another to see the results individually - if I start taking both on the same day, I won't be able to know what helps me reduce my fatigue / anxiety.

      "The reason you're experiencing better erections is that excess iron increases shbg (sex hormone binding globulin) that binds to free testosterone decreasing the amount available for the body to use. By removing the excess iron you remove the excess shbg essentially boosting free testosterone available for your body to use. This is why it's important to test for free testosterone levels rather than total testosterone. You can have high total testosterone but if shbg is high you can have low free testosterone. If you don't want to donate blood another method to decrease iron is to use the supplement Inositol Hexaphosphate also called ip6. This bonds to metals like iron and pulls them out of the blood. I've chosen this method as a much quicker alternative. Just make sure to take Magnesium and electrolytes to backfill any reduction there as well because ip6 is extremely efficient at removing all metals and minerals.",
      "Ok, so first off I am a layman much like many of you reading this and what I'm posting is parroted from some online forums and youtubers I trust. From my understanding elevated iron can be detrimental to free testosterone in the male body. Women who regularly experience their menstrual cycle lose blood and by association iron on a monthly basis. Male hormone health has suggested donating blood in regular 1-3 month intervals to help regulate your iron levels. I didn't expect it to make this dramatic of an impact, but I'm glad it's working for you. Your experience correlates with the information I've gathered so far online. Good to know, and thanks for the info. Cheers!",

Since you were already **monitoring your blood work regularly**, it makes sense that you wanted to explore ways to balance your iron levels. Some people look into **blood donation** as a way to manage elevated iron, but responses can vary. Since **vitamin B12 and B-complex play a role in red blood cell production**, adjusting supplementation may also influence iron status\u2014but individual needs differ based on diet, absorption, and underlying health factors. If anyone is considering changes related to **iron levels or supplementation**, it\u2019s always a good idea to **consult a healthcare practitioner** to ensure they\u2019re making informed decisions based on their personal health profile.",

As someone who\u2019s been into natural remedies and Ayurvedic herbs for years, I can say you\u2019re definitely on the right track with Ashwagandha it\u2019s one of the most well-researched adaptogens out there. But here\u2019s something you might find interesting is that I personally didn\u2019t notice major results when I was taking plain Ashwagandha on its own. What actually worked for me was a combination of Ashwagandha, Shankhpushpi, and Brahmi. These helped me regulate cortisol, support mental clarity and stress relief, and worked great for anxiety and brain fog. I take mine in capsule form once at night, about 30\u201345 minutes before bed, and sometimes in the morning if I\u2019m having an especially anxious week. Within a couple of weeks, my sleep started feeling deeper and more consistent, and my brain didn\u2019t feel like it was constantly racing. It helped me feel grounded.

      "Simply adding one isolated vitamin or mineral you are deficient in doesn\u2019t increase that level. It just isn\u2019t that simple. The human biological system is so much more complicated. This happens a lot with iron levels. Iron supplements alone do not raise levels if you are having metabolic syndrome issues, unbalance, the beginnings of insulin resistance etc. and even when healthy, you need to get a full blood screening. Not just basic level. A full bloodwork done. See a nutritionist for further explanation. Then you will know what complex of different supplements you need that will bring your body into balance to absorb what you need. Even if you are considered very healthy, you still need the right combination of supplements. Isolating can actually help more dangerous. For example beta carotene by itself causes more oxidation and can create more cancer cells. But eating carrots that contain the spectrum of colours, fibre, nutrients and beta carotene has a healthy effect. Even the beloved vitamin c by itself need a low balance of vitamin e so that receptors of the vitamin c that then become changed are repaired by the vitamin e as an over simplistic example. The truth is, on top of taking the proper supplements together, the best way to heal is to eat foods closest to its raw forms. Eliminate raw sugar. Eliminate all processed foods you have in your house like cereal and any empty grains. Eat well. Take vitamin D3 with K2 synergistically. Take a good magnesium. Not carbonate garbage. Take a quality fish oil with the A C and E in the proper amounts and a great b complex along with a separate under the tongue b12. That is the base. Essentials. Now add meats, healthy wild caught fish, you can buy blast frozen wild caught fish if you do t live near the clean ocean areas. It\u2019s not expensive either. Add pumpkin seeds, walnuts, very small amounts. Put white vinegar on some broccoli and arugula and spinach salads. Have lettuce leads as burger buns. Increase onion and garlic intake. Mushrooms for your gut bacteria. That is a great start. You eat like that and drink water and no sugar garbage drinks you will see your blood levels normalize. The idea of one isolated pill fixing low levels is the garbage that doctors sell you with prescription medication. Trust me who learned the hard way. I developed metabolic syndrome and type two diabetes , thyroid disease, high blood pressure. Get to the root cause. Eat whole foods. It is turning my life around. My friend trust my advice. Your body is a beautiful healing machine and if the levels you are having trouble with are not going up, it means your body is trying to tell you something else is out of balance. It\u2019s a great thing and happy healing. Build with the foundation I suggested with the right portions and supplements are just that. Helping. Not the base of the pyramid. So much more to explain. Please research the key points I shared to understand why. All good things in moderation. Feed your gut bacteria properly btw!",
      "Before assuming that about Thorne try another brand or two with similar products and see if it makes any difference. I'm not as sold on some of their gimmicky blends that are very expensive and try to combo tiny bits of various ingredients. Even their Multi Vitamin Elite is almost the same formulation as Basic Nutrients but is double the price. They also charge $61 for L-Theanine when I can get one just as potent for 1/3 the price at ND. Their Fish Oil is super pricy too for a small dose. But their Basic Nutrients is the best multi I've come across. I love their Vitamin D, K2, Magnesium, and Creatine and those are priced reasonably. Their Rhodiola is quality and a small dose (100 mg) so you can control how much you take. They have potent Lysine and Iron supplements as well that are gentle and well absorbed.",
      "That sounds really terrible. But might I suggest that a possible reason your zinc values didn't go up is your intestinal issues? A second test you could do is take a 30 mg zinc bisglycinate from another trusted brand and see if you blood level goes up. Same with l-glutamine. It's sort of weird where it can be helpful but it also increases blood urea, so it's something you should be careful with. I take Thorne Curcumin Phytosome (switching from Life Extension Curcumin Elite) and had a dramatic positive improvement in symptoms. But last spring I took Thorne Quercetin Phytosome and did not get hayfever relief I hoped for. However I took a lower dose. I just thought that pbytosome form should need lower dose. Next year I may give a higher dose a try or might move on. I also take Thorne Vitamin K, but expect it to work in the background.

I can say with complete certainty to avoid the brand Canprev. They have not provided me with a certificate of anylisis, nor were they able to answer my question regarding their supposed methylated b complex. The b5 portion is a mix of both panthenine and calcium panthonate, I think my enquiry of what is the exact % of each portion of the b5, is very justified, seeing that it\u2019s labelled as being an active b complex. As it stands, the product may only have 5% panthenine , and 95% calcium panthonate. Needless to say , when they finally got back to me 2 weeks later, after 3 friggin emails, my question was never answered , and the request for a COA, was completely ignored. We as supplement takers need to avoid brands like this, and let\u2019s let eachother know of such bad experiences but also highlight the good experiences with good brands. These supplement companies are nothing if it isn\u2019t for us consumers.. That being said, I\u2019m really really happy with the California gold nutrition brand, and with Swanson brand. Communication with them is complete fresh air, and is the standard in which I\u2019ll be holding all brands to. Both of the brands I mentioned are often using patented trademark ingredients when ever possible. And they are extremely transparent. Don\u2019t take my word for it, give it a try, see how refreshing it is communicating and receiving information from both those brands. I\u2019m currently using a veggie joint formula from California gold, and it\u2019s all trademark ingredients \u2026",
      "Currently using Thorne for the first time and my experience has been very good. Basic multi 2/day and hormone advantage. Based on my experience I would definitely try other products from them. I\u2019ve used a lot of products from great brands where I didn\u2019t notice improvements. And other times I did. I think that matters most is that what you\u2019re taking can properly address what is going on in the body. Good luck OP, I know there is some kind of zinc / copper / magnesium relationship that perhaps you could explore. It can cause problems if you don\u2019t get the right balance while supplementing and I think I even read it can further deplete you"

You as an individual are ultimately responsible for your health because no one else can live your life for you. Even if they could, would you really want them to? That being said if a Dr isn't going to listen to your concerns and treats everything that isn't a prescription as snake oil then I don't personally see the value in going to see them. SSRIs while they can potentially be helpful depending on the individual are not without risk. Anytime you tamper with chemicals that impact your brain and heart you are dealing with very serious drugs. My point isn't to scare you but to give you an idea of the seriousness of the medication. We also don't have the full picture here. Did he say a highly refined epa supplement was always \"snake oil\" or \"snake oil\" int he context of treating something very specific that he was suggesting the ssri for?

I include all the stuff that is promoted on daytime talk shows, youtube, etc. How is a doctor supposed to navigate through all this? Who will pay for the time needed to be informed enough to make responsible decisions? I, too, come away disappointed when I speak with my doctor but I doubt that switching doctors will improve the situation. Look at how much info is covered in the relevant sub-reddits? Who is able to determine responsibly what is useful or not, patient by patient? The biochemistry of the supplement marketplace adds so much complexity to the already difficult task of prescribing conventional meds. I've thought about looking outside the US for advice. But the US is where the laws permit the greatest amount of personal freedom to try supplements. You might be able to buy some things in India without a prescription but I highly doubt that an Indian physician knows how to advise you. I try to contribute to these sub-reddits because this is the best way I've found to find solutions for myself. I appreciate everyone who does the same.",
      "As someone with chronic illness, YES. YES. YES. This has been my experience with most (not all) MDs as well. Example: I have lupus. I radically changed my diet to mostly plant based, removed processed foods, gluten, caffeine, and drastically increased water and omega 3 intake. I rapidly improved. When I asked my rheumatologist if he believed my diet and lifestyle changes made any difference (just curious to see his response) he flatly said \"nope.\" I go to a top 10 hospital in the country for my healthcare. And that was the response. So yes, i agree - the disconnect is truly staggering and extremely frustrating.",
      "I have completely changed my feelings about SSRIs after learning more about epigentics\u2026 It is GODDAMN AMAZING that we\u2019ve found a drug that can subtly shift how our body processes neurotransmitters in a way that for many doesn\u2019t completely throw our brains off kilter and for many (including me) are wildly helpful. That said, it makes total sense that they won\u2019t work for everyone or that there are side effects. if serotonin reuptake isn\u2019t your issue, then of course SSRIs aren\u2019t going to work for you! \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f At the end of the day, neurotransmitters are made in our guts. They need an enormous amount of co-factors to produce them (vitamins, minerals, amino acids), plus a healthy gut biome to help the process. Also it\u2019s helpful if your body isn\u2019t struggling with a large toxin load or inflammation. In other words, we need to be WELL physically to be well mentally. SSRIs are amazing. But to ignore the mind-body connection and not look at head to toe wellness is foolish. Is fish oil the best thing to use? Is it an either/or? Well it depends/not always. But IMO it\u2019s worth at least looking at low-impact interventions that can support what our bodies naturally do."

      "This is why I roll my eyes when people say things like \"trust the doctors and scientists\" as though you're supposed to have blind faith in them. Sometimes they are right, but sometimes they are just very wrong. There is no consensus anywhere within the scientific and medical communities. There are different camps who have different biases and you should never have blind faith in just one person or group. If you can afford the time and effort to figure things out with research and second opinions, you really should. My Mom has been struggling with chronic illness for 30 years, and when I became old enough to start helping her and joining her on her appointments I was shocked at just how little these people listened or tried. How few questions they asked before they started handing out medication, how many medications they will prescribe without even discussing them. My Mom has been at this for so long and she has the blind faith mentality. Half of her health problems today are a result of the meds she is taking but she refuses to even consider that possibility. She is on 15 medications and has never researched a single one, but I have and I can see that the meds are hurting her but I can't get through to her. She can barely remember anything these days- to the point that conversations with her are exhausting because she can't find her words. I've tried to tell her that people who take as much Gabapentin as her have had a lot of problems with mental functioning but she blames it all on her health problem rather than the medication, and that's not the only one she takes that is infamous for plunging your mind into a thick fog. I don't really know how to help my Mom anymore but the culture we have surrounding the medical industry really needs to change so future generations don't fall into this trap. The medical industry has obviously saved a lot of lives and we learn more every passing day, but there is still something very off here that we need to address, something intentionally malicious lurks beneath the surface.",

But I find it funny, because I rarely have had doctors that provide any sort of knowledge regarding clinical trials on what they try and prescribe. Yes, there are prescriptions that work for people. Not saying all big pharma meds are bad. I get that. Normally, when I've brought up said trials, even on my phone to read over with the doctor, they get very impatient and irritated. To them, they're the expert who went to school for eight years. Wtf would we know about anything? I mean, it's not like we have all the same information that they have, right in the palm of our hands? But, I agree. The disconnect is real, and its intentional. There's no money for these companies if people look for cures and safe treatments outside of the medical industry's purview.",
      "There actually is a middle ground, but it is going to still involve you doing a lot of the legwork on your own research. Don't get caught up in black and white thinking about this.

      "I have been taking supplements for years. I have always had faith in them. I have taken many supplements over the years which I believe have had positive effects on my health. But you have to bear in mind that supplements have to be taken over a long period of time to get the full benefit of them. Being someone who once suffered with very high blood pressure over many years and being someone for whom the meds from the doctor were inadequate, I decided to look into which targeted supplements I could take to bring my BP down. These are the supplements which I found to be very effective: nagnesium, vitamin K2, vitamin D3, high quality fish oil. I also take cod liver oil, which I have great faith in. So effective have these supplements been that I have had to halve my doctor\u2019s medications recently because my blood pressure was running too low; consequently, the low BP was causing me a great deal of dizziness. The other supplement I have great faith in is iodine \u2014 the two forms. I take Iodorol, but only twice a week. An adequate iodine intake is essential to good health for both men and women. I have great faith in it. Especially for the prostate and for eyesight. Further, twice a week, I also take Retinol (vitamin A) for my eyesight. The fish oils, including the cod liver oil, the iodine, and the retinol have all helped my eyesight. Even at my age \u2014 I am retired \u2014 I am able to read a book or the computer page without having to wear glasses. A few years ago, I would have struggled to do that! In fact, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do it. So don\u2019t let anyone tell you that supplements are worthless. They are not. I have found targeted supplements to be very beneficial. I do not, however, take a multivitamin. I hope this helps.",

Fun (?) fact but it\u2019s also used to protect the liver in the case of a Tylenol overdose Also magnesium at bedtime, I take this one pretty regularly. It started out as an attempt to have more vivid dreams but I kept with it because I have deeper sleep and my stomach issues are easier to manage. I still struggle with my iron intake but from learning about supplementation I plan my meals pretty carefully too, making sure to pair citruses with red meat, I eat a very serotonin rich diet and time my consumption of black tea and coffee away from meals.

      "Methylated vitamins B complex (rich in B12 cause of they're poor bioavailability, more than others), very balanced and no BS. Tyrosine Tryptophan NAC Caffeine Tried also ashwaganda ksm66 but didn't really felt a difference, maybe I tried while I was medicated by my therapy which includes heavy stuff like Klonopin/Xanax, methadone and Seroquel. Then others supplements I let in \"maybe they're work better if not medicated so heavily/more for others ppl but no placebo) is beta alanine. Those last two I didn't notice much for the reason described, tyrosine helps definitely, I can swear on it, caffeine just because is a bomb of 200mg of it and it's the king of the most use/abused substances in the world. NAC at 1200/1800mg definitely felt more relaxed and get rid off of cravings for stimulants a bit, help also on tolerance and gave a little typical NDMA-antagonist effect but need to push the dose, overall is more subtle then others but work indeed and you'll notice better when you stop taking. More if you have tolerance for ADHD meds and you stop abruptly which most are stimulants or have a substance abuse disorder that can involve meth, cocaine or amphetamines use. Helps also for opiates craving and maybe more for those substance that gave a Mental-Addiction only, like a person who used for example amphetamines for couple of weeks without ADHD or another used to have an evening appointment with dissociatives like ketamine.

I've seen results in not only myself, but my mother in law, and my finance. Turmeric is an anti inflammatory, ginger is a natural pain killer, and the black pepper just makes it more bioavailable in your body (helps it absorb better) along with other benefits these all provide. Although with my mother in law to be, her joint pain was so severe it did take 3-4 months for the pain to stop completely. But for me and my intermittent hip pain, it was gone within weeks.

Though honestly I was expecting little (or nothing) - so feel wasn't placebo. 5 htp took a few days, but strong/noticeable mood boost, surprised me. A great assist in breaking out of deep funk. Theanine was milder, but does help. I scored! It was tag team I needed. (I was on cusp I getting new Rx, but now opting not to, we'll see where things go.) Fyi, I'm new to it.

Dunno if they still make it? Theanine It has many benefits including: *Reducing elevated blood pressure. *Reducing stress & anxiety. *Improving relaxation. *Improving mood *Decreasing stroke risk *Improving concentration It doesn\u2019t actually make you sleepy. I do take it before bed, however, bc it relaxes me so I more easily fall asleep. I also take other sleep aids with it.",

Now I only take it when my anxiety comes back. Quitting coffee was a big part of why I improved, so many benefits, better sleep, better focus, no unnecessary restlessness and anxiety. I\u2019ve been too addicted to it, and It\u2019s so freeing not to rely on that one drink that gave me anxiety. I replaced it with hot chocolate, iced matcha and anything similar."

      "Thanks for posting this. I am an extremely healthy person and also take a fair number of supplements. With all the stuff happening in the country I started l theanine (nature made and now thorne labs) about 10 weeks ago. I'm usually a positive person but I had been feeling particularly \"zen\" these last couple of months. I did not attribute this to the l theanine but just assumed I was in a good space and wise, lol, but then I ran out of l theanine and almost immediately I started feeling \"crabby\" and tired. At that point, I had absolutely not made any connection that it was from stopping the l theanine ( I was only taking it b/c I follow Andrew Weil and at some point he talked about it being helpful for the brain) but I said out loud, and to anyone who would listen, \"I am feeling kind of negative and so tired these past few days\". Then I thought it might be from the l theanine and my shipment had arrived and after just two days my mood and energy are back to where they were. As much as I believe good supplements provide \"insurance\" and I do take a fair number of water soluble vitamins, I have never experienced something this dramatic. I am inclined to think this isn't a coincidence and that the l theanine is indeed a good supplement. I appreciate others noting a tolerance so I think I will henceforth go for alternating days.",

For a week or so it was wonderful and she felt way better, but sadly I think she developed a tolerance quite fast because now she's back to how she was feeling before. I believe she might have to cycle it, which you might also need to do eventually. As for me, I was really hoping it would help but it honestly did nothing for me at all.",

If I take it on 2 consecutive days I can almost guarantee day 2 will be nothing. Day 1 will produce effects on maybe 30% of the times after probably 20-30 or so lifetime uses"

Be careful using it longterm since lecithin in general may promote high levels of TMAO which can contribute to arterial plaque. Citrulline Malate over Arginine: simply stronger (in my opinion) and erection seems firmer. Pygeum: doesnt really increase cumshot but does increase precum marginally.

      "I'm glad that you found something that works for you! Magnesium glycinate is a popular magnesium supplement due to its high bioavailability. It contains glycine which can be beneficial for sleep. Some persons have an adverse reaction to it. It would be interesting for you to try a different form of magnesium, such as magnesium citrate, to see if you notice the same benefits. This would help you determine if you are benefiting more from the magnesium or the glycine. Some people take glycine on its own, usually in doses of several grams or more. If you determine it's the magnesium (which it very well may be), consider improving your diet with the prioritization of magnesium rich foods. Examples include whole grains, dark leafy greens like spinach, bananas, dark chocolate, coconut water, and pumpkin seeds. You may wish to split your doses of magnesium to increase absorption. Since magnesium glycinate can promote sleep, you may wish to take a different form in the morning.",

Also some hand numbness/tingling occasionally. I\u2019ve had episodes of this in the past that have gone away on their own for many months. This time, I went almost a year without any issues but in the last 6 weeks or so, it\u2019s been happening again almost daily. Been to doctors and neurologists in the past who don\u2019t know what it is, besides potentially occipital neuralgia. I lift weights and do cardio 6x a week, eat healthy, no smoking/drinking/drugs of any kind. Anyway, I did some research and it seemed clear that all of my symptoms were potentially from a magnesium deficiency - even the fact that I can only stay asleep about 6 hours instead of my preferred eight, and my anxiety. Last night with dinner, I took 200mg of magnesium glycinate in pill form (Nature\u2019s Made brand from the grocery store). This morning, I woke up feeling worse than I have in many years. Severe pain behind ears when it\u2019s normally mild, extreme nausea, multiple bouts of diarrhea, and feeling very groggy as if I took NyQuil or something. I am now scared to take it again. Wanted to get some advice - did I take too much? Is there a better supplement? What could be the issue? Everyone seems to swear by this form of magnesium but it made me so sick.",

I think magnesium is one of the minerals that is more difficult to adequately obtain through our foods than say.. potassium, calcium, sodium, and etc. I've had similar experience as yours. I also had tense muscles around my shoulders, neck, and upper back for a looong time which were alleviated by supplementation of magnesium. I've tried magnesium citrate (Calm supplement), and initially enjoyed the benefits, but it started giving me vivid nightmares every time I took it before bed. Sometimes I enjoyed the dreams, but more frequently the dreams were was so vivid and surreal that the thoughts of the dream would linger throughout the day. There were times when I would wake up in the morning quite groggy as well. Some say Magnesium oxide is a poor form because it doesn't absorb well, but others beg to differ. I've done well on magnesium oxide, and I found it to be more gentle far as effects go, and I absolutely enjoyed how pleasantly easy it made to go to #2. Now I take Doctor's best chelated magnesium which is in the form of lysinate-glycinate magnesium. It has been really great (but no added benefit when going #2). The downside is that the tablets are huge and I've choked on them. I just chew them with some water. They taste kinda sweet but a bit funky. Nothing I couldn't get used to though. Oh! and another thing is transdermal magnesium oil! They're quick fixes and are amazing!

Zinc competes with copper for absorption in the gut. So long term zinc supplementation can cause a copper deficiency over time. However if possible take them 6-8 hours apart. Like copper in the morning the zinc at night. Not necessary to supplement, if you are getting meats and leafy greens, but magnesium helps with zinc utilization and vitamin b6 synergizes with zinc in hormone and brain function.",

What day of the week? For a real experiment, prospectively randomize 5-10 of the next 50 days on which you will drink. Cancel and move these days only if you will be unavoidably driving.

      "What you\u2019re feeling the morning after heavy drinking is a neurochemical rebound. Alcohol suppresses your brain\u2019s excitatory systems (like glutamate) and enhances inhibitory ones (like GABA). Once it clears, your system rebounds\u2014glutamate spikes, dopamine surges, and you get a brief high: early waking, mental energy, sociability, even a sense of emotional openness. It feels like clarity, but it\u2019s a withdrawal artifact, not true balance. For people with chronic inhibition or anxiety, this contrast can feel euphoric. But it\u2019s a trap. Over time, this turns into early-stage kindling where that same rebound becomes anxiety, insomnia, or irritability. It\u2019s not recovery. It\u2019s a disguised crash.",

I have a fair amount of medical education, and I\u2019m used to seeing people\u2019s charts and interpreting lab values. I\u2019m a 37 year old male. My testosterone is usually around 650-700 ng/dl. I don\u2019t consider that unusual. I also lift or run every day. Sex or masturbation once a day isn\u2019t unusual either, it\u2019s well within normal frequency, pretty typical for a healthy man in his thirties. A sex drive like that is a good sign of health. The main reason why many men in their thirties nowadays often have lower testosterone and libidos than used to be typical is excess fat and a sedentary lifestyle. That\u2019s unfortunately pretty normal now, but it shouldn\u2019t be. If you\u2019re lifting and training for marathons, you shouldn\u2019t compare your hormone function to theirs. You should also be aware that testosterone levels aren\u2019t the only thing that contributes to sex drive. There are other hormones at play, and other factors that drive desire for orgasm. If you\u2019ve heard of or experienced \u201changover horn,\u201d which is feeling like death after heavy drinking but being incredibly horny at the same time, then you might be interested to know that this is actually related by the effect of *suppressed* testosterone but elevated DHT after drinking. If you are unable to focus without orgasm, or if you feel that it\u2019s almost a daily compulsion, that\u2019s probably not normal, depending on the severity, but it\u2019s likely related to other psychological or physical factors than your testosterone levels.

I contribute that to: Ensuring I'm meeting al my micro nutrients. Staying hydrated Sleeping 7-8 hours and 9 hours when I'm off. I also take creatine and legion fortify joint support. I feel like the joint support may help.... but I think maybe the overall micro nutrients, being hydrated, and sleeping.",
      "Yes. I have terrible DOMS. 51M. It took a lot of research but what finally identified the issue was a StratGene report produced from 23 & Me dna data combined with research time using ChatGPT and the uploaded data. What I learned is that I have dna SNPs (inherited DNA that causes a metabolic process to work slower than it should) that impact nitric oxide production and detoxification pathways. Specifically the issues are with: NOS3, MTHFR, GSTM1 & GSTT1, SOD2 genes. What this means is the when I do intense exercise low nitric oxide production results in the inability to properly push blood/oxygen to the muscles resulting in lactic acid & ammonia build up faster than those without the SNPs. Because I also have slow detoxification pathways (also from SNPs) I can\u2019t remove to lactic acid and ammonia quickly resulting in long term DOMS. My resolution (tailored specifically for my DNA and SNPs) is to supplement with: L-Citrulline Vitamin C and Magnesium to help support more efficient nitric oxide production, then take a methylated multivitamin and NAC to support my slower detoxification pathways. These supplements are known co-factors required for proper functioning of my specific gene SNPs. Not sure if this will help you, but that\u2019s how I\u2019ve successfully reduced DOMS.",

I've found that to be the best prevention. When I do get DOMS, I do some reduced exercising or lifting on the sore muscles. Usually 70% of my normal works well. If I'm really sore, I will go even lighter. The one supplement that helped my DOMS was vitamin D3. If you live in an area with cold winters and hot summers, you are likely low on Vitamin D3.",

      "MBSR body scans and Yoga nidra guided meditations are my ultimate sleep hack. After my dad died, I had intense crippling insomnia that was treatment-resistant and that lasted 14 months. I had tried a ton of supplements, including melatonin, valerian, passionflower, wild jujube extract, chamomile, tart cherry juice, magnesium in multiple chelated forms, etc., and six prescriptions: trazodone, Zaleplon, mirtazapine (same dose), Doxepin, gabapentin, and Clonazepam. Nothing worked at all for me, and all of the prescriptions gave me side effects. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia failed for me, and I was seeing a behavioral sleep specialist with the Cleveland Clinic. Thank God, I had started meditating and came across those meditations. The more body scans and yoga nidras I did, the deeper and more restful my sleep got. I was able to go back to sleeping 7+ hours per night after practicing for at least two hours per day. It also got rid of the major depressive disorder and panic attacks and grief surges and horrific nightmares (these last ones were one of the side effects of the mirtazapine for me).",
      "Mirtazapine absolutely destroyed my body, and I was only taking it because I had no other options at that time, after being routinely dismissed and misdiagnosed for decades with supposed mental health problems rather than the physical illnesses that I was really suffering with. It helped me get to sleep I guess but not exactly well or very healthily, so I stupidly kept taking it because I didn\u2019t know any better then, and had no idea that it wasn\u2019t all \u2018just in my head\u2019 as I had been told, but it was at the expense of damaging my liver apparently, which I really didn\u2019t need at that time due to me slowly dying from the untreated hypothyroidism, combined with all of the problems I was having from the other undiagnosed health conditions I had too. If you actually need to take something like that then go for it, but if you are only taking it for sleep or something like that, then I\u2019d say there are safer or healthier alternatives out there than that, which won\u2019t affect you in ways that you might not even realise right now. Meds like that cause various physical health issues like weight gain, and I was even prescribed antipsychotics at one point too which were so horrible that I instantly felt suicidal. I presume that the doctors were hoping I\u2019d be happy to feel zombified by these really harsh meds that I didn\u2019t even need. I know that me being misdiagnosed isn\u2019t the same as someone being properly diagnosed and needing the medication though, but something about the way you associate these meds with sleep, stuck out to me but feel free to ignore me if I\u2019m just projecting lol.",

These days, I mostly just consume glycine, it's faster/cheaper. It also improved my sleep, concentration, and energy levels and is now a goto vitamin for me. I just chomp glycine powder, it's not bad tasting, it's one of the aminos that taste a bit almost like sugar. Here is thing, glycine is required for many liver detox processes and also for mitochondria to make energy. It's also a main scaffold for production of skin, hair, nails, cartilage, ligaments, and of course collagen, if you are low, you'll have issues across many body functions. Glycine is a key component in the synthesis of glutathione too. Glycine is also involved in the regulation of nerve signal transmission and I improved the way I can walk and move after supplementing, it seems like maybe i had a lifelong deficiency as I'd dragged my heels when walking since I was a teen and that all stopped by itself decades later almost overnight from glycine sups. I actually had to readjust my walking style a bit, my legs were suddenly ready to march like a high stepping horse thanx to glycine. TLDR, glycine is one of my few must have supplements that makes a huge difference and for which I notice problems reemerge pretty fast if I stop.",

      "I like Function, and will definitely use it one more time at least. Here is my overall general take. \\--The comments are obviously AI written. As others have noted, they are not actionable comments. On the other hand, to do so would get them in to the practice of medicine, and forming a doctor patient relationship. So I get it. \\--I really dislike the UI, but on the other hand I hate most Web displays nowadays. Too much emphasis on scrolling pages, poor use of screen real estate. The aesthetics over utility emphasis is very annoying. Things should be very compact on the page so you can get a single screen view. Results should look more horizontal like a spreadsheet instead of vertical. But again, this stupid \"aesthetic\" is everywhere. \\--The biological age clock is bogus -- but really all of them are, so I don't blame them. Anyway, everything is based off of Morgan Levine's work, which is as good as it gets, but not THAT good. \\--The LDL breakdowns are opaque. They don't have a simple VLDL measure, which they should. At least give me that. They should also do a Trig/HDL ratio -- just a simple calculation. \\--Here's the biggie in my view -- no way, as far as I know, to download your data into a standard file, such as a CSV or XLSX. I have years of data I would like to combine with stuff from Function, and it all has to be done by hand. Somebody posted a script, but I couldn't figure out how make it work. I have assembled a lot of Peter Attia's and Tom Dayspring's optimal numbers and I would really like to compare my Function numbers with a simple download, but can't do it."

      "I do take some supplements but just consider them aids for fixing and preventing deficiencies. All non-supplemental \u201chacks\u201d have had a much more noticeable impact. Here are a few of my favorites in no particular order: ## Flickering lights. * Relaxation, sleep, creativity, light version of psychedelic microdosing, neuroplasticity, Alzheimer\u2019s prevention, sharper focus and much more * Relatively cheap for a simple version using an app and your phone\u2019s flash. Can spend hundreds or thousands on fancy devices. ## Balancing. * Great for posture and body feeling. But I love it because it really helps regulate my mood. Might be the regulating impact on the ANS. * Free or cheap but you can also pay a bit more for fancier toys. I Started with a balance board for less than $10 from a discounter and have several different versions by now. ## Sleeping on an incline. * More oxygen during sleep, less sleep apnea, less back pain. Supposedly supports brain detox, but can\u2019t say anything about that. * Free if you just prop the head side of your bed on some books. I bought a wedge mattress once I realized I really like it. ## HRV breathing. * Regulates ANS, calms, reduces anxiety, fixes sleep. * Free if you just start breathing (lots of free resources available). $50 if you want to get a Polar H10 chest strap to get biofeedback on your HRV through some app. ## Meditation. * Similar benefits as flickering lights and HRV breathing. * Free if you just start doing. A few hundred to thousand dollars if you want brain sensing gadgets that give biofeedback. I use Muse which helps me build a consistent habit. I\u2019m still relatively new to this. ## Walking barefoot. * Body feeling, joints, posture etc. * Free if you just do it. Can spend a few hundreds on barefoot shoes if protection is desired. I own Fivefingers. I\u2019ve just recently started this up again and hope to make it a permanent thing this time. Edit to add some extras: Mobility work (love low squats), acupressure mat, IF, fermented foods. My focus currently is on: Posture, joints, natural body movements and functionality.

Now I\u2019m considering speaking with my health care provider for a pharmaceutical solution which absolutely breaks my heart. So take that with a grain of salt but it\u2019s my experience.",
      "Yup sounds right - I'll also add this not sure if it's relevant. I absolutely had shedding when taking creatine... tried 3 different times, each time I noticed increase shedding about 3 months in where hair was visibly thinner. This only happened during the period in my life when I was occasionally taking recreational drugs and drinking moderately or heavy on weekends. Fast forward to later in my life now that I am sober for many years and much healthier and I can take creatine with no visible shedding or thinning at all. Could people that drink or take drugs be not eligible for these studies that show no hair loss? Could it increase inflammation per your theory? Idk and plenty of people will tell me \"then it was the drinking!!\" And like, sure but it was only when interacting with creatine (I partied like this for 10 years or even heavier at other times with no visible hair loss). It was the interaction somehow threw me over the edge. When I would quit the creatine my hair would get back to normal even though I would continue the partying etc. I always tell people about my experience if they have hair thinning from creatine because maybe it could be an interaction with other factors or medications in their life. Basically you need to be in a healthy place to take creatine or you might experience some hair thinning.",

      "I indeed lost all of my hair, over about 10-12mnths, from an inflammatory response, due to an autoimmune dysfunction. This created a severe inflammatory arthritis as well, several years later it fully manifested as a form of bone cancer requiring a quick transplant. In that span of time this inflammatory response caused almost all of my hair to fall out on my entire body, except nostrils and eyelashes. This is as just one way it manifested besides all of the higher priority issues like avascular necrosis and osteonecrosis. It was entirely mis-diagnosed and misunderstood for many years before exploding in severity. I urge anyone experiencing this to more fully examine your bloodcounts and metabolic panels, get lymphocyte subset panel of your bloodcounts. I have had some success with other areas of treatment, but this direct link between rapid hair loss and a runaway inflammatory process would have been an early warning to much more serious things to come, if it had just been examined a bit more closely at the time. It\u2019s just my anecdotal experience, but I firmly can confirm OP\u2019s suspicion in my personal example. I\u2019ve done daily creatine for the majority of nearly 20yrs, and have very little to no discernible side effects. A bit of water retention and bloating if I stop abruptly and restart, but fairly minor",
      "I think the theory sounds thoughtful, but I would not think too hard about explaining this supposed phenomenon. There is almost no value in anecdotes especially for something as sensitive as hair loss. People will see stuff that is not there. They have studied whether creatine causes hair loss directly (not just DHT, but actual hair loss) and have found no difference to placebo. [Does creatine cause hair loss? A 12-week randomized controlled trial ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40265319/) There is an analysis of this study here: [https://youtu.be/XK8uW7FIEuU](https://youtu.be/XK8uW7FIEuU) Let me note though, that the whole DHT rationale is also flawed. Tons of things raise your DHT, including eating eggs and weightlifting. And you already get creatine from your diet. You're not introducing anything new.",
      "Good theory my man - no clue! But I recently cycled creatine (having no clue hair loss was a possible side effect)\u2026 within 2 weeks I was like \u201cwth why is my hair evacuating my head\u201d & discovered that it\u2019s a known creatine side effect. Decided to quit & I think my hair recovered mostly. I know a lot of people get upset when a supplement they really like has negative side effects, but I can attest that (for me) creatine & hair loss have a potent correlation!",

The NIH gave 5 million tax payers dollars to study alcohol effects on finches The NIH gave 240k taxpayer dollars to study the effects of cocain on bees. 500k for teaching pigeons to gamble 600k grant to study feces throwing in chimps and which hand they do it with. 1.3 million on making shrimp run on tiny underwater treadmills. 500k on if selfies make you happy. The list goes on and on. While some studies are except use of taxes, some are clearly just to spend the allocated budget. All this money is tax dollars from you and I. I'm not for the elimination of the NIH but I am in favor of a grant that studies if the NIH was using taxpayer dollars in the most efficient and effective manner possible. I know dissenting opinions are not allowed but it doesn't take much to see that there was some wasteful spending of tax payers money going on. I'd rather they lower taxes on those making less than 50k than fund frivolous studies just to ensure they get a bigger budget next year. Reward reducing an agencies tax payer allocated budget, don't reward agencies for surpassing their budget in order to get more tax payer allocations the subsequent years.",

It\u2019s especially beneficial as it supports over 300 biochemical reactions in the body. Definitely a staple in my daily routine. * Blue Light Blocking Glasses - Since I work late into the night, wearing these has helped reduce my eye strain and improve my sleep patterns. The difference in my sleep quality was noticeable within a week! * Bidet Attachment - Installing a bidet has not only enhanced my bathroom hygiene but also reduced my exposure to the chemicals in traditional toilet paper.

I got two dark green leather ones with ottomans for about $350 each. From 2 different sellers on Craigslist a few years ago. They are comfortable. Have a slim silhouette compared to most recliners. They swivel. Recline well. I pretty much live in one while I'm on my computer most days. 2. Levenger Bean-shaped lap desk. My husband actually made one for me just like theirs but it's a simple thin piece of wood that's bean shaped and easily goes on the arms of an armchair (see # 1). I can put my laptop and note pad and pens on it and work all day. About $99 on the Levenger's website but they go on sale every now and then for less. 59.99-79.99. They also make a stand-alone version like a mini desk that is on a slim stand like a TV tray. It folds flat against a wall when not in use. 3. Simple electric water boiler. Zillions of brands. Under $25-30? Use it for tea, pasta, hot water for my hot water bottle, hot water to warm my grandsons bottles, etc. It just works and gives me a pot of boiling hot water in minutes. 4. SinuPulse sinus rinsing machine. $89.00. Kind of like a waterpik for sinuses. I have to rinse once a day and I like the gentle pulsing and cleansing effect. There are other brands."

I also bought the special filters for pets and ones for smoke after the horrible forest fires last summer. Buy it now!!! It makes me feel like I\u2019m breathing in air from the Swiss Alps. Lol. Plus, it doubles as a white noise machine. 2) Hot yoga and Hot Pilates (High Intensity Interval Training - HIIT) classes. The room is between 90-100+ degrees. You sweat, build strength and gain flexibility. I\u2019m not naturally very flexible but the heat allows me to stretch without hurting myself. Makes me feel so good mentally and physically. Game changer. 3) Oral B electric toothbrush. I bought the basic one on Amazon for around $30. My dentist has noticed a difference. I had tried all the other very expensive ones and they were not great. 4) Trtl neck travel pillow and ear plugs make traveling a breeze! You will be able to sleep through anything. 5) Tile Pro for my keys and Tile Slim for my wallet. The one on my key chain has a button I can push to make my phone ring when I misplace it in the house. No more stressing to find my keys or phone in a hurry. Plus, unlike AirTags, you can \u201cshare\u201d the tag with other people so they see where it\u2019s located too. Also buy a glow in the dark cover for it on Amazon in case you drop it at night. **EDITED TO ADD:** 6) The \u201cCPTSD\u201d subreddit. I stumbled upon it by accident. I had be never heard of it before. It stands for complex ptsd. Complex meaning it was ongoing trauma versus just a one-time event. For example, fighting in a war would be on ongoing versus getting mugged one night. I learned that my childhood trauma was at the root of my lifelong depression and insecure attachment etc. Years of therapy telling me to think positively, use CBT etc. hadn\u2019t helped.

      "I appreciate your thorough and thoughtful post. While I have my doubts about the prospective health impact of targeting methylation measurements, with the analogy being it's like rolling back the odometer on a car (the wear and tear is still there), you've raised a number of interesting issues. With respect to PQQ, I had not heard about it as an agent for mitochondria biogenesis. I'm wondering now if there is any data to support the idea that PQQ supplementation can increase endurance or even raise VO2max? I'll have to look into that. Another issue is with respect to niacin raising your fasting blood glucose. How certain are you of this effect? Blood glucose is something I watch closely, as I used to be prediabetic and I'm on a statin, which seems to boost my blood glucose. I have been taking 250mg of niacin daily, but I'm going to cut that to see if it impacts my glucose. With respect to lithium, I'm taking 2.5mg daily for neuron support. My kidney biomarkers have been fine, so I don't think I'll stop that. Thanks for your interesting and informative post.",

I am currently suffering from depression (dysthymia), anxiety, anhedonia (emotional numbness), insomnia and concentration issues. The thing is they haven't been induced by any event happening at some point in my life. Rather, I've just always had them, since I was little, as if I was born with them. This has led me to believe they are caused by some genetic defect. I've recently found out about MTHFR mutations and how they induce the very symptoms I have, along with others I also have, but haven't mentioned. I want to test myself for the gene as well as homocysteine levels and some others. If I do have it, I'll supplement methylfolate and cofactors to hopefully get better. However, from what I've found, people are split into two camps when it comes to MTHFR. Apparently , many doctors don't take it seriously. However, there are studies that do, as well as lots of people on Reddit talking about how methylfolate has changed their life. What's your take on the whole MTHFR thing, and what should I test for alongside the gene itself? Thank you and sorry for the long message!",
      "Great post. Looks like you're missing one of the most powerful anti-aging compounds in existence though. Possibly the most effective one. The peptide, Epitalon. increases the production of telomerase, which strengthens and lengthens telomeres. There's quite a few reports flying around of people knocking 20 years off of there telomere age after a 10-day Administration. It should be done two or three times a year typically for maintenance. Since the effects tend to be most pronounced for 6 months after the treatment I believe in animal studies that extended lifespan of monkeys and mice significantly. Restores pineal gland and pancreatic function. Increases resistant to leukemia by 800%, and supposedly prevents and shrinks tumors."

      "You do realise that promoter methylation is only one of MANY ways epigenetic mechanisms suppress/silence or promote gene expression right? Some methylase remodel chromatin directly without promoter region hypermethylation in fact many researchers in this area now suggest promoter methylation has been over emphasised which has been demonstrated by protein expression still occuring for very methylated gene promoter regions and genes silenced with no promoter methylation at all. This is why whole epigenome methylation studies aren't helpful at all in determining gene silencing or promotion. And even when a gene appears epigenetically silenced the protein may still be found to be coding suggesting some how it is still being promoted. Let-7 and similar mRNA and Mecp2 can themselves alter gene expression via chromatin remodelling and suppress protein elaboration and this is very difficult to measure or assess. So this appears completely unsupported by science in this area. The last thing I'd say is that in research settings even when there is strong evidence of a pathology being triggered by an epigenetic mechanism physicians are reluctant to trial HDAC inhibitors because they can have unexpected genome-wide consequences. You might target the rescuing of tumour suppressor genes and inadvertently activate another silenced gene in the genome that has pathological consequences."

      "Medial epicondylitis or \"Golfer's elbow\" is typically a sign of a muscular imbalance. IE since you're lifting weights, you spend a lot more time gripping really hard, so your flexor muscles and tendons are stressed. It's relatively easy to rehab. One, don't ice. Ice should be used for acute injuries, and really only in the first 24 hours post-injury. Past that, you're stifling your own recovery with it. Heat and active recovery is far more effective. Someone else suggested using the Theraband Flex bar, and I concur. It's an excellent tool, and will last you for several years of use. Extend-Your-Hand Bands from Ironmind is a set of graduated resistance rubber bands that you use to train your extensor muscles, which helps offset the muscular imbalance caused by constantly using your flexor muscles. Both of these tools can be used daily, for small sessions of 3-5 minutes, 2-3 times a day. Neither is particularly expensive and they are readily available from Amazon. For gym days, especially if you're doing something grip intensive like deadlifts, rows, or other pulling motions, spend some time during your warmups doing a couple of sets of light weight dumbbell reverse wrist curls. Again, you're working your extensors. The extensor work in general will also have the effect of stretching and gliding the flexor tendons without putting a lot of force in to them, and increasing blood flow which speeds recovery. It may take a few weeks to see improvement, but it tends to be fairly quick. Keeping up with your extensor work even after the elbow feels better will help prevent future issues. I'm 48 and an amateur strongman athlete and these exercises have helped me a lot in the past and keeps me healthy despite the extremely high grip demands of my chosen sport.",

One or two cups of coffee before 14:00 have proven to be even beneficial, for what I have read. * *Ear plugs & eye mask*: Not for me though, I like to wake up with sunlight (and my kids waking up at 07:00 sharp, lol) What I would add: * Big glass of water when waking up - Get hydrated quickly * Different types of exercise during the week (strength training & cardo, try to work out on both sides of the spectrum)",

The natto is for fermented protein and some nutrients which are otherwise hard to get from foods. It's an acquired taste but super satisfying if fresh. Wheat germ for spermidine is another new one I'm trying. Good list BTW",

      "> 10 minutes in the sun after waking up *stares at cat who\u2019s blocking the ladder of my loft bed and cries* Can I ask about the no phone for four hours in the morning? Like, is that a personal thing, or is there some science behind it? I\u2019ve heard of there being benefits of not using your phone a few hours before bed, but not four hours in the morning. Do you use other electronics during that time, like TV, radio, MP3 etc.? One hack I have, I heard from Andrew Huberman. I have a light by my bed and a smart switch. I believe he said that if you turn a light on two hours before waking, it could have a positive effect on circadian rhythm and alertness. I could be misremembering the time and the exact benefits, but I\u2019ve just started doing this a few times this week. To my knowledge, natural sunlight from the sunrise can work too, but I have light blocking film on my windows that I require for medical reasons.

      "So many people are lacking magnesium and in general it is cheap, has zero negative interactions that it also makes it a really wonderful and often game changer to add in. Also getting enough magnesium then also helps you to better absorb other vitamins and minerals that you may already be taking supplements or getting enough in your food/diet but just not actually able to absorb if you don\u2019t have sufficient magnesium There are different types of magnesium and some work better for different people eg glycinate is the best form to help with sleep but not the best for everyone Something like epsom salts in regular baths is absorbed in via your skin and great for a super relaxing bath before bed. Or you can also get magnesium spray oil to directly massage into sore areas eg neck or shoulders I think that magnesium and fish oil especially when fish oil is combined with D3 and K, and then a good multivitamin or B complex and also probiotics are the best and most effective supplements for 90% of people to take Unless you\u2019re lacking in a particular vitamin or mineral eg Iron it\u2019s hard not to try multiple supplements especially for when you just feel exhausted but it can be dangerous to just add in vitamins or minerals because a friend etc finds they worked brilliantly for them - some can be dangerous for some people But magnesium is one of the main ones most of us lack and a safe, cheap thing to try. Plus also helps you to absorb other things that despite getting enough of those need magnesium to really be absorbed properly Eg calcium supplements if you have a deficiency you\u2019re much better to get a formula that also includes magnesium, vit D and K in the right quantities to work in synergy But if you jumped the gun assuming you were lacking in calcium but actually lacked iron or vice versa too much of one can prevent you absorbing the other properly There are no tests (that I know of anyway) that can determine if you are lacking in magnesium but it generally is such a well tolerated supplement that most people don\u2019t or can\u2019t get enough of in general healthy diets because even lots of organic vegetables etc these days the soil isn\u2019t rich enough in it. But such a brilliant, cheap and effective supplement to take with little or no problems for anyone to try (unless you\u2019re on medication or have a rare condition that you\u2019ve been advised NOT to take) I\u2019ve never heard of that being an issue but am no expert or scientist so possibly for some people this may not be good to take however for 90-95% of people it\u2019s a wonderful supplement For some of you then yes maybe a different variant eg glycinate is better and for others a different form is better Most of us can also use epsom salts for a lovely relaxing bath, or if you don\u2019t have a bath or don\u2019t like them you can also get magnesium oil based spray to massage in directly to sore muscles or I just ordered this wonderful body scrub for in the shower that is mostly all magnesium Epsom salts plus super skin beneficial oils and pure lavender essential oil -it\u2019s soooo nice to use as a body scrub and smells delicious (I love lavender essential oil though) and so good to use in the shower before bed if I can\u2019t be bothered having a bath So many different ways to use magnesium Some people find supplements give them diarrhoea but other types don\u2019t. Others particularly like those ones if they generally have constipation issues to auto correct that For anyone who finds different types of magnesium don\u2019t agree with them I\u2019d recommend Epsom salts in a bath, or if you don\u2019t like or don\u2019t have a bath to try the magnesium oil sprays to massage into sore areas (for me it\u2019s my neck, others might be their knees or hips or back etc) or a body scrub like the one I just bought and love which is cheap from iHerb For me magnesium is probably the best supplement for most people to try as it is so safe, so useful and most of us lacking in Especially for anyone on a keto or carnivore diet this is a critical supplement you must take as is a major electrolyte you need that gets flushed out of your system along with other fluids and while sodium is easy enough to get you also really need magnesium more than the usual person",
      "Oxide is not the most efficient form. Try something with a combination of magnesium and you may see even better results. I take one with glycinate, malate, and citrate daily and one with just threonate occasionally at night for better rest. That said, Good for you. It\u2019s amazing when you find that thing that clicks and you can function all of the sudden. I also get the frustration. I was a decent alcoholic and not heavy, but consistent drug user for all of my 20\u2019s. Most of that time trying to figure out why I was living a lifestyle that I knew made me feel like shit all the time. Then I found antidepressants and realized it was because I already felt like shit all the time. With them I was able to function and begin improving on my diet and health which allowed me to figure out I am super sensitive to gluten and I now am off all medications and super healthy.

      "Well said. At first, it was awesome. The buzz was great, the mental clarity was awesome, I felt instantly awake and it almost seemed like I could breathe better and had more endurance for workouts. It even seemed to have strong anti depressant effects, when the Rx I had at the time wasn't doing shit. Nicotine truly is a great drug... ... for a few months. Pretty soon all the positive effects went away, and instead all I would get from it is feeling like shit if i DIDN'T have it. That was my sign to quit. And it gets expensive. Why pay all that money just to feel like shit all the time?",

Its short-term benefits are real, but there are significant long-term risks to overall health. Nicotine quickly enhances alertness by activating attention, vigilance, and dopamine-driven reward circuits, but even occasional use rapidly alters nicotinic receptor density, reinforcing continued use. Nicotine consistently elevates heart rate, blood pressure, and vessel constriction, causing arterial stiffness, endothelial dysfunction, and increased cardiovascular risk\u2014especially in those already vulnerable. Nicotine disrupts estrogen and testosterone pathways, harms fertility and reproductive function, and damages fetal development and offspring health\u2014even without smoke exposure. If cognitive enhancement is the goal, use tools that create durable neurobiological adaptations without systemic harm. Vigorous exercise boosts BDNF and cognition; cold exposure increases norepinephrine and focus; dietary flavonoids from cacao enhance cerebral blood flow and cognition without disrupting vascular health. Cognitive performance should be built, not borrowed.\u201d I\u2019ve been using pouches or gum on and off for the last few years. I like the immediate pick me up but feel a noticeable decrease in energy and mood. Really zaps my excitement for most things. Good reminder to look for better options. Thought about trying getsett.co but this worries me: \u201cCeretine\u2122 binds to nicotinic-acetycholine receptors (nAChRs) in the brain - thus promoting higher levels of dopamine and acetylcholine in the brain.\u201d The higher the high, the lower the low, right?",
      "> Nicotine is not a bio hack. Prob true for majority of the population but I've seen a lot of people that have recovered fully or had big improvements in their Long covid/long vax/ME/CFS from nicotine patches. Literally hundreds of people. You can even see the user's long posting history in some of the bigger ME/CFS groups on FB, posts that go back years. It doesn't guarantee that they're not lying/faking it, but it's a pretty good indicator. I have also experienced an improvement in symptoms, specifically my brain fog and memory issues after low dose nicotine patches. I haven't used them in over 6 months (due to trying other things) and the improvement in memory is still there.",

What just happened is the limit of that overhead charge was reduced to 15%. For reference, many non-profit grants cap overhead at 10 or even 5%.

      "Female here. Can confirm it works wonders for me. I started taking it (500 mg) regularly in my mid-30s when I found it helped me focus better at work and in school. Funny - when I was dating back then, I would \u201csave\u201d my daily dose for dates because I felt like it gave me social energy and \u201csocial motivation.\u201d I experimented with taking two doses a day but found I got headaches, hence the strategy of \u201csaving\u201d the single dose/day.

It\u2019s possible I\u2019ve developed a tolerance over the last 8+ years of taking it daily, but I still take it everyday in the morning. It\u2019s a good reminder to take it on an empty stomach like all amino acid supplements. I may experiment with taking more to see if I\u2019ve built a tolerance, get headaches, etc. I\u2019ve recommended it to others along the years with mixed results. Either they have the same instant wow this makes a huge difference in how I feel, or nothing noticeable. My favorite and only brand I use is Pure Encapsulations.",

      "L-Tyrosine is a precursor to dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, so in theory, supplementing with it could boost motivation, focus, and even libido if those neurotransmitters were previously low. However, the effects tend to be more noticeable in people who are under stress, have depleted catecholamines (e.g., from intense exercise or fasting), or have lower baseline dopamine levels. Could This Be True? Yes, it's possible that L-Tyrosine helped the person in the post, especially if they had subtle dopamine depletion. Some key factors that might make L-Tyrosine effective in their case: Low Dopamine Levels: If their neurotransmitter balance was off (even with good hormonal health), adding a dopamine precursor could have helped. Absence of Stress: Since stress depletes catecholamines, L-Tyrosine is often more useful in stressed individuals. However, it can still be beneficial for someone whose dopamine levels were just naturally lower. Individual Response: Not everyone reacts strongly to L-Tyrosine. Some metabolize it efficiently, while others don't experience much change. Placebo Effect: Some effects could be psychological\u2014expecting an increase in energy and libido might have reinforced the perception of improvement. What Does Science Say? L-Tyrosine is proven to help with cognitive function in stressful or demanding situations (e.g., military training, sleep deprivation). It may improve performance in physical activities where neurotransmitter depletion plays a role. Its effect on libido and motivation is less studied but makes sense if low dopamine was the limiting factor. Should You Try It? If you suspect low dopamine (e.g., low motivation, mild depression, brain fog, or reduced libido despite normal testosterone), L-Tyrosine could be worth a try. However, effects vary, and it's not a magic bullet for everyone. If you try it: Start with 500mg on an empty stomach in the morning. Increase to 1000mg if needed, but don't overdo it\u2014excess dopamine can cause irritability or anxiety. Monitor effects over a few weeks. Would you consider trying it, or are you looking for alternatives?",

As others have noted, they are not actionable comments. On the other hand, to do so would get them in to the practice of medicine, and forming a doctor patient relationship. So I get it. \\--I really dislike the UI, but on the other hand I hate most Web displays nowadays. Too much emphasis on scrolling pages, poor use of screen real estate. The aesthetics over utility emphasis is very annoying. Things should be very compact on the page so you can get a single screen view. Results should look more horizontal like a spreadsheet instead of vertical. But again, this stupid \"aesthetic\" is everywhere. \\--The biological age clock is bogus -- but really all of them are, so I don't blame them. Anyway, everything is based off of Morgan Levine's work, which is as good as it gets, but not THAT good. \\--The LDL breakdowns are opaque. They don't have a simple VLDL measure, which they should. At least give me that. They should also do a Trig/HDL ratio -- just a simple calculation. \\--Here's the biggie in my view -- no way, as far as I know, to download your data into a standard file, such as a CSV or XLSX. I have years of data I would like to combine with stuff from Function, and it all has to be done by hand. Somebody posted a script, but I couldn't figure out how make it work. I have assembled a lot of Peter Attia's and Tom Dayspring's optimal numbers and I would really like to compare my Function numbers with a simple download, but can't do it."

      "Physical therapy for hEDS muscular gains and proper connective tissue support. My kid\u2019s knee sublaxes often; turns out it\u2019s her hip that causes it. Surprising little amount of exercise with bands, bodyweight, similar basic things guided by PT has built muscle, with strength and endurance gains, and her knee has been nice and in place ever since. Working on other muscle groups/joint areas as well now.",
      "Took Ostarine (20mg/day M-F) for 2 or 3 months along with Cardarine (20mg/day M-F) on top of my trt. I got stronger and my endurance got higher. One month after I stopped, I was back to my regular strength. Endurance lasted a while to get back down to baseline (think it raised my red blood cell count). It was cool to try, but it didn't have any lasting benefits for me and those are compounds you shouldn't run in perpetuity like Test (trt dose).",

And non steroidal SARM\u2019s aren\u2019t efficacious for muscle growth, this is why they were pulled from clinical trials and big pharma gave up on them. If you decide to do this low dose ostarine cycle, expect the ostarine cause almost zero muscle growth and expect to be shut down if you run it longer than like 4 or 6 weeks.",

      "But\u2026 that\u2019s not high? Normal range is 300-1000 ng/dl. High would be above that. I\u2019m not an endocrinologist, but I am a nurse. I have a fair amount of medical education, and I\u2019m used to seeing people\u2019s charts and interpreting lab values. I\u2019m a 37 year old male. My testosterone is usually around 650-700 ng/dl. I don\u2019t consider that unusual. I also lift or run every day. Sex or masturbation once a day isn\u2019t unusual either, it\u2019s well within normal frequency, pretty typical for a healthy man in his thirties. A sex drive like that is a good sign of health. The main reason why many men in their thirties nowadays often have lower testosterone and libidos than used to be typical is excess fat and a sedentary lifestyle. That\u2019s unfortunately pretty normal now, but it shouldn\u2019t be. If you\u2019re lifting and training for marathons, you shouldn\u2019t compare your hormone function to theirs. You should also be aware that testosterone levels aren\u2019t the only thing that contributes to sex drive. There are other hormones at play, and other factors that drive desire for orgasm. If you\u2019ve heard of or experienced \u201changover horn,\u201d which is feeling like death after heavy drinking but being incredibly horny at the same time, then you might be interested to know that this is actually related by the effect of *suppressed* testosterone but elevated DHT after drinking. If you are unable to focus without orgasm, or if you feel that it\u2019s almost a daily compulsion, that\u2019s probably not normal, depending on the severity, but it\u2019s likely related to other psychological or physical factors than your testosterone levels. From your description it doesn\u2019t sound like you meet the criteria for hypersexuality, but maybe there\u2019s more to it than you\u2019ve said.",

      "I had a few phases where I had sex 2-3 times a day but currently only do it once, like you. Afaik there's nothing wrong with it, no health related downsides and it makes me feel better overall. So it's normal I'd say. My test levels are 840ng/dl as a 200lbs 6'2 male. My free test is 490 pmol/L, whatever that is in ng/dl.",
      "Both your test and free test are not that high. Guys on TRT are on 2000ng/dl and 75ng/dl free test. Quadruple your range. You\u2019re just a healthy dude. Enjoy it while it lasts.",
      "I think there are two parts. 1 is it possible testosterone is making you horny. The answer is yes! 2. But as important is how do you feel if you don\u2019t get sex or masturbate? Sexual frustration can be fun. Being a little pent-up can spell a good time. However if you are using sex to make yourself feel better it might not be just horny it could be compulsive. Horniness just exposes the issue hut isn\u2019t the issue. It\u2019s like overeating. Eating is fine but if you eat emotionally it can be problematic. If that\u2019s the case then your horniness could be exposing some emotional vulnerabilities that are worth looking into. Which one do you think you are experiencing?"

What day of the week? For a real experiment, prospectively randomize 5-10 of the next 50 days on which you will drink. Cancel and move these days only if you will be unavoidably driving. Randomize day of week, work load, hydration status. Keep everything else the same. Drink at home vs going out and getting laid. Same music and energy level.

Alcohol is a poison and as you age and ingest more poison, your body gets worse at processing it.",

      "What you\u2019re feeling the morning after heavy drinking is a neurochemical rebound. Alcohol suppresses your brain\u2019s excitatory systems (like glutamate) and enhances inhibitory ones (like GABA). Once it clears, your system rebounds\u2014glutamate spikes, dopamine surges, and you get a brief high: early waking, mental energy, sociability, even a sense of emotional openness. It feels like clarity, but it\u2019s a withdrawal artifact, not true balance. For people with chronic inhibition or anxiety, this contrast can feel euphoric. But it\u2019s a trap. Over time, this turns into early-stage kindling where that same rebound becomes anxiety, insomnia, or irritability. It\u2019s not recovery. It\u2019s a disguised crash.",

Since this was your fault, then you must put in as much effort as possible to get this fixed. Don\u2019t you just accept that it\u2019s gone. Called the FBI. Call lawyers. The bank should be helping. Don\u2019t just roll over and accept it. The police have abilities to look these things up, they just don\u2019t want to spend the money. You must insist.",

You are a victim here. Just because they said no once doesn\u2019t mean you should stop escalating. Be polite, be professional but be insistent on speaking to someone who can help you. Continue to escalate higher and higher until you get as high as you can possibly go. Request to speak to the ombudsman or escalate it to the external bank regulator in your country (hopefully there is one). Go to the press if you need to. A financial institution does not want bad press and this may get the attention of the people who need it see it. Please do not be deterred by fearing people will judge you, so many people fall victim like this but are too embarrassed to say anything so everyone thinks they are the only one.

I should have called her and been suspicious of the email for etransfer, I kept asking what it was for , they said kitchen stuff and Thanksgiving stuff. Canadian Thanksgiving is in October and it didn't click we already had it. Everyone on her fb was sent a msg and obviously angry. My bank did not reverse it and it made the budget tighter.

Consider it gone the second you buy. Or, just don\u2019t mess with crypto at all. It\u2019s mostly a scam at this point.",

And remember I was the dumb dumb that didn\u2019t like a crying baby in my youth. I\u2019m that much more conscious about a crying baby. Becoming a mother has soften my harden heart. Babies just cry. I wouldn\u2019t think ill of another woman for a crying baby now. Sometimes it just out of your control.",
      "Would have been handled with zero tact or grace, but I think I have that look on my face because the few times I\u2019ve had buddy and he\u2019s been crying nobody\u2019s bothered me. That lady can go fuck herself and/or die",
      "What a horrible woman. You did nothing wrong. We can do everything right - baby has slept, been fed and changed before going out, and they can still cry! Especially at 1 month! Parents have lives, we can\u2019t be permanent shut-ins out of fear that our baby might cry once we step foot out the front door. Unfortunately there will always be people who will tut, sigh, complain when we go out if baby kicks up a fuss. Or even if baby is just squawking and making happy noises in the pram (which has happened to me!) As hard as it is, just ignore them and don\u2019t hesitate to tell them to mind their own business - or better yet, fuck off!!!"

      "I have an almost 10 month old who is EBF and refuses Dad overnight and doesn\u2019t take any bottles lol. Dad is a teacher and only gone 8am - 3:30pm (unless something extra is going on). Usually day starts at 7am. We get up, bum change, and LO is ready to play. This used to be a glorious 30 minutes to an hour of drinking my coffee and relaxing nearby but now she is pulling to stand on everything and crawling so it\u2019s more chasing her. She has breakfast around 8am and husband leaves, I finish my coffee. We kill time until first nap - walk, reading books, more play, facetiming nana (this is one of the fussiest times of the day). First nap 10am - 11am. I will either nap with her or take this opportunity to get myself food and ready for the day. Sometimes an outing upon wakeup, the store, a playdate, a baby group, a walk. Lunch. More filler at the end of this wake window if needed with books, toys, etc. Second nap 2:30 - 3:30pm. Often will at least rest with her for this one. Then, Dad is home and either takes babe and I cook, or he cooks! We spend the rest of the evening having supper together and then Dad does bath and gets baby ready for bed and I nurse to sleep. (Nurse to sleep x 3-1000 times a night at each wakeup depending lol). After bed we do a quick clean up (bigger cleans on weekends) and then I do my part-time work (about 10-15 hours a week). Currently on 1 year mat leave in Canada and due back full-time at the end of the summer, once LO is in full-time care and I continue to work remotely I feel it\u2019s going to feel like a break lol. I didn\u2019t get a real routine until we got down to 2 naps / 3 wake windows with 3 meals. Also we do a date night in on Fridays and wait to eat after LO is asleep and have charcuterie typically lol Some days where I\u2019m really tired or the weather is gross I will just laze around with her all day and play lol (this is a lot). If I could go back to the newborn phase I would slow down and do soooo much less.",
      "We actually didn't do sleep shifts. I would wake up anyway anytime the baby cried (mom brain I guess). So I handled night wakings because I was woken up anyway and it seemed pointless to ruin both our sleep since mine was already ruined. Hubs had no paternity leave. He was gone from 5 am - 5 pm weekdays. When he came home he would take over with the baby and I'd try to get time out of the house by myself (go for a walk alone, talk to a friend, etc.). We did dinner together and then baby would go into witching hour until 10 or 11 pm and fuss for 4 or 5 hours typically at that age. So it would take both of us to get through the fuss. Sometimes I would nap with hubby home from work during the week, but it was actually more important to me at the time to have time together with my husband than to sleep more. I napped more on the weekend when he could take on more of the day hours. Once baby started sleeping one 4-6 hour stretch it became easier for me and I didn't feel as terribly sleep deprived as at the beginning. I must say at 8 weeks I was still pretty miserable. 3 months was a big improvement for me and then again around 8 months was a huge improvement. She is 15 months now. She sleeps through the night maybe 3 or 4 days per week and wakes up once other days. So I get enough sleep and she goes down at 7:30 pm so I have time to myself in the evenings. It does get better. Newborn is just the trenches honestly. Sounds like your schedule is pretty good.",
      "We never did shifts, at least for sleeping, and I don\u2019t think we ever will. We both had parental leave, my husband 3 months and myself 4 months which just ended this week. I feel extremely lucky because our baby is naturally very calm. She typically sleeps from about 9pm to 5am and we both go to bed at about 9:30-10pm. She did recently wake at 3/4am to eat for a few days but hasn\u2019t this week. My husband is an early riser so he\u2019ll prep her for a feeding (change, warm bottle, etc.) and bring her to me and then go workout. After she eats at around 5:30-6am, I\u2019ll get myself ready with her in the bouncer. She falls back asleep around 7:30-8am and sleeps until 9am when I feed her again. My mom who takes care of her while we work gets here around that time as well. My husband is usually done with work around 3pm and he will take over everything with baby until I\u2019m off at 6pm. Then we tagteam everything until bed! Shifts just never made sense and it felt too hard for both of us to work something out especially when we were blessed with a rather good sleeper. I\u2019m not sure what I would do if she wasn\u2019t, so solidarity to all who are having to manage that. You are stronger than you know!",
      "So I have a 14.5 month old so quite a bit older but this is what we do and it\u2019s been pretty similar the whole time. My husband leaves for work around 7:30 and gets home around 5:35 on a normal day. Pretty much as soon as my husband gets home he takes over as what we call primary. Now that little one eats all solids, he cooks dinner for him, feeds him, plays with him then does bath and bed. My husband does first shift at night so if baby wakes up before 1am he gets him and if he wakes up after 1am I get him but that can change if someone is really tired/had a hard day. But to be fair, he really only wakes up once or twice a night about once a week now. When little guy was younger my husband would still take over as primary pretty much right when he got home except I would handle bedtime and feedings from 8:00-2:00am then I would go to bed. Until about 6 months we were in survival mode. Our baby had really horrible reflux combines with massive feeding issues that required feeding therapy and took a toll on all of us. Once the reflux got better and feeding became less stressful, everything got better. We could leave the house more frequently, get more sleep, and we all started to feel better. You\u2019re still deep in the trenches but I promise it gets easier.",
      "Also struggling! Partner is usually gone from at least 6 AM to 6 PM, and we prioritize his sleep. He doesn\u2019t want to \u2018work\u2019 anymore when he gets home. Well, neither do I! I\u2019m so unbelievably grateful that he\u2019s paying 100% of the bills right now, but also I kind of low-key hate him sometimes\u2026 Honestly, we\u2019re probably headed toward couples therapy. In the meantime, I\u2019m doing what I can to give myself grace around house cleaning tasks, and compassion around everything. I nap when I can. And I just trust (hope?) that it will get better."

      "I am so, so sorry this happened to you. I had my own PPD as a mom and I can't *imagine* if my husband had been also struggling in the way it seemed like your partner was. Honestly, I think I'd have felt incredibly resentful and scared in your shoes, which is not to say that your partner doesn't have a right to have had his own depression -- just that it's hard for you both, and as a birthing parent, typically you're the one doing a lot of the healing/hormonal rollercoaster. You are 100% not the asshole, and this is 100% not your fault. I'm so glad to hear that things are better now that baby is a little older. But it also makes sense that the 180-degree shift is bizarre and that you're still struggling with how the last many months have been. It damaged your relationship, fractured trust, and left you in survival mode for a LONG time. I haven't experienced what you have, but if I were in your shoes, I think I'd be looking at some couple's counseling. Would your partner be open to that? Now that you both have the benefit of (a little bit of) hindsight, maybe it would be a good opportunity to reflect on what you were each experiencing and how it affected the other. My (first) baby is only 6 months old so I know I still have hindsight to gain myself, but I'm sure will be hard times to come as a parent even though we're out of the newborn stage. It might give you some peace of mind to work through what happened so that when the next hard time comes, you have tools in your emotional toolbox that you can deploy from therapy."

Using it to enhance your interactions with them - even better. People get way more hung up on screen time than they need to. If screen time gives you the mental space so you have less negative interactions with your child? This is a win. Not a loss. People need to use targeted screen time with their kids more. The current cries of no screentime with no evidence actually supporting that is worse than unhelpful. Parents irrationally saying hard no to all screentime...

      "No, you\u2019re not and in fact you\u2019re very lucky that you have your mom there to help you out with things. Being a new mother is a very hard. And when I was with my ex-wife and my son was born, I tried to help out as much as possible, but because my work was a distance away it made it very hard for me to do it. I was very fortunate that my late ex mother-in-law was there to help out with the baby and even my own mother came by occasionally to help that is what families are for to help out each other when needed and you are not a loser you were a new mother who is overwhelmed, which is perfectly understandable. Congratulations on your new baby. Here\u2019s another bit of advice. I can give you if you haven\u2019t gotten one yet get it. It is a rocking chair. They are a godsend. It will come in handy when you feed your baby and putting it to sleep or when you burp, the baby, it will both be relaxing for you and your baby and you\u2019ll probably put quite a bit of use.

      "Not a loser at all. Especially if this is your first, there is such a massive learning curve to it that it would be foolish to not have the help of someone who has done it before you and can help you learn the ropes. On top of all the other things that are happening with your body and the baby's during those first few months, if you have the help by all means utilize and appreciate it. At some point you will have had enough practice and help doing things, that you feel like you will be able to do things on your own and her help will become nice to have, not necessary to have. It all takes time and everyone is different. But if you need the help at the moment and she is willing to give it, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that! And grandma's love time with their grand babies so I'm sure she is cherishing this time as well.",

Taking care of a newborn is hard as hell and no one is prepared for it. Have you heard the saying \u201cit takes a village?\u201d It does. You feel guilty because many modern moms have this belief that it\u2019s a \u201cflex\u201d to do everything by themselves when in reality it was never meant to be that way. You are one person and getting help WILL make you a better mom because you will have enough time to rest and practice self care. Many moms believe they have to give up everything and never take care of themselves and that is wrong\u2014- you cannot pour from an empty cup. Also, a lot of grandparents love helping because they get to spend more time with their grandchild. I\u2019m sure your mom loves helping you. You are not doing anything wrong, and labeling yourself as a loser is a cognitive distortion because it\u2019s a way our brains distort reality. 7 weeks is barely any time at all and, even so, moms need help with kids of ANY age.

      "I don't think mine really truly responded to his name until he was 12 months or so. He's 15 months old now and he definitely knows his name. He probably knew it sooner but never really responded to it. Now that he's mobile and gets into everything, calling his name, makes him pause so he knows it. But I feel like toddlers are like cats and know their names, just choose to have selective hearing \ud83d\ude02",

      "I was worried about it too because we almost never called her by her actual name but My baby is 8 months old and recognizes her name, and has for a few months. She can verbally say mama, and tries to say milk. We have been teaching her sign language as well, she can say milk, dad, mom, eat, more. And wave goodbye. She responds appropriately when I say \"look at mommy\". She also has said uh oh a few times when appropriate. I think the sign language has really helped her with word associations. We think she is advanced though, she's also been crawling since she was like 5 months and is almost walking now. We call her baby genius lol. Edited to add that she chooses when she wants to acknowledge her name. She will side eye us if she's doing something and doesn't want to stop what she's doing when we call her name to get her attention.",
      "Just make sure you're calling him by it regularly and not a nickname or something like sweetie/baby and don't worry too much about it. 6-8 months is generally considered the timeframe for some recognition and from 9-12 months there starts to be a clear response. I stressed a lot when I was asked at my LO's 6mo appt because it wasn't all the time and I wasn't really sure. By the 9mo appt it was much more clear he understood it. He's 11mo now and even if a stranger (like a friend's husband he hasn't met before) says his name he reacts."

      "Mine is 5 months old and I've just started to worry about this because we are *TERRIBLE* about calling her by name. It's always Princess, Baby, Love, Sweetheart, etc. I remember a story from college from a therapist who went into a school to evaluate a kindergartner for hearing impairment. The teachers had reported that he wasn't responding when called on, was quiet, etc and thought maybe he had a hearing problem. She went out to the playground to find him, called his name, he just kept going, no response. His big sister happened to be passing by so she asked her to go get her brother for her. Sister yells out, \"Hey shithead!\" (Or similar, I don't remember exactly) and the little boy instantly looked. Turns out his hearing was fine, he just had asshole parents that called him shithead all the time. Poor baby thought that was his name. Definitely trying to work harder on calling her by name.",
      "I mean this gently, but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily worry about that. I\u2019m no expert, just a second time mom, and I\u2019ve learned from experience that there will always be something to worry about. Your baby will learn their name. I thought that the window for babies to begin registering their names was 5 months. I\u2019d say that if you have concerns about your baby\u2019s hearing, to bring it up to your pediatrician. But at least in the US, they conduct a newborn hearing screening at the hospital. Just keep speaking to your baby. Exposing them to speech is so important. Label things you\u2019re doing, label what you see.",

      "My daughter had an early interventionist due to some post-birth complications raising the odds of her developing deficits and it was her who suggested we try Ms. Rachel because of the tone of her voice and the focus on the mouth movements involved in basic speech. Before this, I was totally adamant that there would be no YouTube in our house (we did lots of music but nothing else) but I put it on later that day just to see what it was about and my daughter was about 7 months old and MESMERIZED, it was incredible. I gave in and let her watch a bit now and then but I\u2019m also the annoying mom who\u2019s fully engaged while we watch something (unless it\u2019s on so I can make dinner or quickly get something done), so I learn all the songs and make it a fun time, not just sitting and staring at the screen. The engagement definitely ups the benefits! Side note, I don\u2019t know if it was because of Ms. Rachel or not but my daughter was an early speaker and is full on reading now at 3. I\u2019ll give Ms. Rachel at least partial credit! We love her still, 2.5 years later.",
      "She has a very kind and cheerful voice. I know screens are controversial, but your baby can learn a lot of words early on and signs by watching her. Also clapping, jumping, counting, colors, food types. We\u2019d let my daughter watch every once in awhile, also just to soothe her at times, then reiterate a lot of the content and it\u2019s incredible how much they can learn. I love what she does for children and truly believe she is great person.",
      "A lot of pediatricians have made the claim that watching Ms Rachel isn\u2019t exactly comparable to other forms of screen time because not only is she actively teaching children, she\u2019s also actively engaging with them - making eye contact, asking questions and providing time for children to answer. It\u2019s not just mindless entertainment, it\u2019s more enriching. So, definitely don\u2019t feel guilty for letting your LO watch for a short period! My LO is 2 now, but even when he was younger I wasn\u2019t super strict on screen time (every family is different) and he loves Ms Rachel! He even learned some baby sign language just from watching her. Even now he\u2019ll grin as soon as he hears her voice.",
      "Ms. Rachel is such a beautiful soul. It's awesome your baby enjoys just listening to her voice!! We do about 30 minutes of Ms. Rachel a day on the TV since he was maybe 4 months? I stay away from animated stuff though because I just think it's good for them to see real humans at this age I guess, I dunno haha.",
      "I think a major underrated reason she helps with speech is because she is also effectively teaching parents professional strategies. In the baby episodes there are tips at the bottom of the screen for what age a milestone is expected at. And copying her strategies when the TV is off is what is making her show work so well. She is an educator so she is just speaking in a way a preschool teacher would speak to keep a child's attention. So I think your baby just liked her speech patterns and listened because she is talking like that because it helps kids listen. We got her potty training book and it's the same way. It's teaching both the toddlers and parents at the same time and basically suggesting that if you try copying her in the book it will help the kids understand quickly. We do what you mentioned and put on our own shows that are okay for little kids but that our son isn't really interested in. But we don't do no shows for him either. We just don't want him actively watching for very long unless he's sick or something. So we do Mrs Rachel and try to copy her when the TV is off. It might be helping because he's doing really well with his language but it could be a lot of things. And we do fun stuff with music he can enjoy. Like if we watch Moana he dances to the music but he doesn't care about the story even a little so he just ignores it and plays. But he will actively watch Bluey so we only watch a little bit at a time."

I\u2019m a SAHM so I think he is grateful for that and it can be overwhelming sometimes but we\u2019re lucky to be able to do that so he never judges me or the house or anything, my job is to look after our baby and he is a wonderful provider who looks after us too. We both take care of the house, it\u2019s not one person job it happens when there\u2019s time or we\u2019re both home, those moments she is happy to play with her toys alone I can sneak off with the hope to clean but it\u2019s usually a toilet trip \ud83d\ude1c your baby is 5 weeks old, you\u2019re still healing, if he is letting you rest do it! it seems you have a great support so just take it day by day \ud83d\udc90 apologies for a long winded comment about nothing \ud83d\ude07",

I felt the way you did when I started hiring help for my newborns. I thought they are bonding, what if they love them more than me? But you needed the rest and you need support you cannot do it all. They will not love you more for your extra suffering because they already love you at maximum capacity even at your minimum. My husband has not bonded and has no connection with our twin babies and I suffered a lot I did every shift alone and in the end the babies smile when they see daddy.

      "I am so very sorry for your loss and your wife sounds like she was a wonderful person. Would you like to share any remembrances to honor her memory, either here or over DM? Don't let anyone ever tell you that you will \"get over\" your grief and loss. She will always be a part of you and your family. May her memory be a blessing. I can understand a tiny bit of what you're going through as a baby loss dad. A few things really helped me get through the thick of it which might help you, I'm only adding things to this list that others haven't already mentioned, all of which look like great ideas. Hopefully these are helpful, and if you think I'm full of it and this is worthless, that's totally valid and I won't be offended. 1. A support group of loss dads and/or loss parents. This might sound lame or like it does not apply to you, but I can guarantee you that these are the only folks that will truly understand what you're feeling and going through. If you need help finding some, I recommend reaching out to a social worker via the hospital where your son was born and/or where your wife was treated. The r/daddit group looks like a good idea, but I'd also recommend finding something like a group video call or in-person meeting, because the non-verbal support of others really made a difference for me. 2. Consider looking for one or more books on loss. I read a few that were very helpful in framing what happened, how (and what) help to ask for, and also working through the grief. 3. If you're not already getting this, have one of your friends or family setup a meal train or something similar to deliver hot meals to you and your son. Makes a huge difference to be cared for. 4. Give others the opportunity to support you and honor your family and your wife's memory by asking for help. Reframing asking for help as giving others the easy opportunity and opening to support you in a concrete way helped me become clearer, quicker and more concrete for the support that I needed. No one can or should do things alone, and your network really does want to help you. 5. If possible, take PTO or a leave of absence from work if any paternity leave you have has already run out. It took me some dedicated time to really normalize what had happened to me, which I couldn't mentally do while I was working. You can also plan to do this after you've returned to work for a bit and the intensity in the beginning has died down. I took around three weeks visiting family a few months after our loss that was very restorative. 6. If this wasn't already clear, it helped me to let folks at work know what happened and telling them how you want to be treated. This is likely easiest with a single note or email to everyone, rather than one on one to rip off the band-aid. If you want work to be a neutral environment, just let them know and they'll respect your wishes. If you want them to ask you about your loss, then tell them that explicitly. 7. Let yourself cry out loud, in front of loved ones. If this doesn't feel like a good reason to do so, I don't know what does. There was nothing more soothing or powerful than doing this, especially when getting hugged and supported by others. For me, grief was very much like holding water in a leaky bucket over your head. You could try to slow the leak or pause it for a little while with a ton of effort, but eventually all of the water would wash over you and honestly it was sometimes helpful to let more out at a time than a little. 8. Get as much help for your kiddo as possible so you can have some moments to grieve. You'll always be his dad, and you'll be the best parent you can be and set a great example for him by taking good care of yourself, even if that means taking a few steps back right now. 9. Give yourself the \"Widower Pass\". You have had an incredibly deep and profound loss, and you will likely not have anything left in the tank after caring for your son and yourself. You may find you don't want to interact with many of the folks you normally do and don't have patience for some others. Your friends and family should understand, and anyone that doesn't may not deserve the privilege of being in your life. This pass will last at least a year and potentially much longer for some really annoying folks. Anyway, I hope that was helpful. My loss story below, in case it's helpful for you: ======================================================= After conceiving surprisingly quickly, our first pregnancy seemed to be going very well until the 20 week ultrasound/anatomy scan. Our baby had a critical congenital heart defect that could either have led to in-utero spontaneous death to a baby with lungs too small to live, to a child with many surgeries and suffering that may have had a shot at a reasonable life expectancy, with no way of knowing where we landed. After a whirlwind of specialist appointments, ultrasounds, medical research and activity over about a week, we chose to terminate for medical reasons to minimize potential suffering, with very little time left to legally perform the surgery. Others may have made a different choice and I don't judge anyone for their choice in a situation like ours. Our baby passed remaining in my wife's body and embrace without suffering. We never learned the sex of our baby, which at the time felt like the right decision but now also feels like a big question mark hanging over us. My family and most of my friends were extremely supportive, but unfortunately my wife's parents just wanted us to \"get over it\" and \"move on\", despite being supportive of our choice. They even had the gall to send us a \"when life gives you lemons\" card, which made me want to burn a LOT of things. We decided they did not deserve to remain in our lives for the time being and we now keep them at a distance. This may change some day but it is what feels right to us right now. Again, I'm very sorry for your loss and I hope you can take the time and care you need to normalize your grief and heal.",
      "I\u2019ve been a solo parent since conception. Was never my plan either. We found out my mom was no longer responding to clinical trials for stage 4 pancreatic cancer the same week I found out I was pregnant after a one-week-stand. My mom was buying clothes for her unborn grandchildren when I was two years old so I wanted to give her this gift. I never imagined I\u2019d be a solo parent but that\u2019s life. I spent my pregnancy in bed with my mom, my daughter was getting ready to start life and my mom was getting ready to leave it. She held on long enough to meet her first grandchild and my daughter slept on her chest for two weeks before she took her last breath. We knew the night before that it was about to happen. My daughter slept in the adjacent room and my brothers, my dad and I sat with mom on her bed and took turns holding her, reassuring her that we were okay with her leaving. Even though none of us were, but she needed to hear this. We just held her and cried, she was already not fully herself at this point. It took me the longest to realize she needed me to let her go. Most of the night I just kept telling her I needed her, and I still have guilt today about this because she was so ready to let go. My older brother signaled to me that it wasn\u2019t helping and that\u2019s when I fought the tears and gave her the blessing she needed to let go. A few hours later, i was anxiously breastfeeding my daughter in the next room just waiting for the worst news of my life. My brother came in and didn\u2019t need to say anything. I handed him my daughter and got into bed with my mom. I spooned her lifeless body and sobbed for a good few hours before we called the funeral home to take her away. I\u2019d always dreamt about being a mom and although it was the one thing I looked forward to more and longer than anything else, there were days during my grieving process when I resented my daughter for needing my attention in those last moments with my mom. Irrational and unfair to her, I know. But this was part of my grieving. I also worried that I wouldn\u2019t bond with her because of my intense grief and sorrow over losing my own mom. I felt responsible for my brothers and my dad, mostly my little brother, now that I was the only maternal figure in the family. They didn\u2019t need me though. My daughter did. Just like your son needs you now. Grieving the loss of your most important person while also having to figure out how to care for a new baby is going to be the hardest experience of your life. But you can do this. I promise. I\u2019ll share with you some of the things I learned from my mom when we laid in bed together for most of those nine months. She was a family psychologist and loved working with children so I filled notebooks with all the parenting tips we could think of during that time. Fast forward my daughter and I have had the most beautiful relationship and the following tips are some of the things I made a conscious effort to do in my parenting that I attribute to our closeness. If you\u2019re concerned about bonding with your son at all then please consider the following tips. Here\u2019s a little background on me for credibility: I studied child psychology in college, all of my volunteer work - pre mom life - was with underprivileged children and I\u2019ve been an ambassador for over 15 years for the orphanage I helped build in Cambodia. I authored a series of childrens books that simplifies language to help them communicate complex feelings in confusing situations. Most recently, when I became a full time solo parent the loneliness hit me hard. I learned that it wasn\u2019t just a solo parent issue, and that 98% of ALL new parents are at risk of experiencing parental loneliness. I saw a need for an app that made it easier for new parents to find likeminded friends so I created the first location based friend-matching app for parents. If you are at all concerned about bonding with your son, now, or at any stage in your grieving process these might work for you too: hold him tightly as often as possible, do your calls with him in your arms with an ear pressed against your chest so he can feel the vibration of your voice (same energy exchange as breastfeeding), he will absorb the energy you exude on a dna level in these moments so be mindful. Find your wife in him and remind him frequently of these similarities, even before he can talk. Keep her alive in spirit, and always tell him that his mom would be proud when he does something impressive, like takes his first steps or sits up for the first time, when he gets his drivers license and so on. Look him in the eyes often and hold his gaze as often as possible (feeding time, story time before naps and bath time are ideal for this), his gaze will be intermittent but yours is steady and he can rely on your gaze being there for him when he returns his gaze to yours = dad is my safe place. Tell him you love him often, even - ESPECIALLY - when/if you\u2019re not feeling bonded to him at times, he doesn\u2019t understand these words but I promise you he feels it. Even when you might not. And btw, disconnect is common for many new moms, too, with or without grieving the loss of their favorite person. Create traditions and routines (babies and young children are receptive to repetition and energy, that\u2019s how they feel safe before they learn how to communicate verbally. They thrive on routine because knowing what to expect next reduces their anxiety and allows them to feel calm and safe. No routine = high levels of stress, uncertainty, insecurity and feeling unsafe. Routine = safe, certainty, security, reliability, calm. Hope this helps. I am so deeply sorry for your loss. Grieving your wife and getting to know your son is going to be a hard but you will get through it. I promise. Take care of yourself but stay strong for your son. Finding this balance will seem impossible at first, but it\u2019s possible and It\u2019s what your wife would\u2019ve wanted. I\u2019m sending you and your sweet boy so much love and strength. You\u2019ve got this. Congratulations on becoming a father \u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf40\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude4f",
      "I am truly, deeply sorry for your loss. My heart goes out to you during this unimaginably difficult time. Losing your wife so suddenly and unexpectedly must feel overwhelming, and the weight of responsibility as a single father can seem insurmountable. It's okay to feel broken and to grieve the loss of the future you envisioned with your wife. Know that you're not alone, even though it may feel like it. Reach out to friends, family, or a support group who can offer comfort and understanding. Surrounding yourself with loved ones can provide a sense of solace amidst the loneliness. Taking care of yourself emotionally and physically is crucial as you navigate this new chapter of your life. It's okay to seek professional help if you're struggling to cope with your grief. Therapy or counseling can provide a safe space to process your emotions and develop coping strategies. As you care for your newborn son, remember that it's okay to ask for help when you need it. Lean on your support network and community for assistance with childcare, household tasks, or simply lending an empathetic ear. Honoring your wife's memory by raising your son with love, compassion, and the values you both cherished can be a source of strength and purpose. Take each day one step at a time, and be gentle with yourself as you navigate this journey of healing and parenthood. Your willingness to share your profound loss and the emotions you're experiencing is incredibly brave and generous. By opening up about your journey, you've not only honored your wife's memory but also provided solace and understanding to others who have walked a similar path of grief and loss. Your vulnerability and honesty create a space for empathy and connection, reminding us all of the importance of compassion and support during life's darkest moments. Thank you for sharing your story and allowing others to find comfort and solidarity in knowing they're not alone in their struggles.

May you find moments of peace and healing amidst the pain, and may the love you shared with your wife continue to guide and inspire you as you journey forward\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f",
      "I am so so sorry for your loss, completely and utterly. While I have not felt the pain of losing my partner after what should be the happiest time I do understand the feeling you might be experiencing of everything completely changing so quickly without any time to brace, prepare, accept, or without getting a say in the direction your life is now headed. I just lost my 7 month old son last month and it's absolutely been so awful. I was a single mom doing it mostly on my own and honestly I was excited. And now he's gone just like he never even existed almost. And as awful as it sounds I almost with he didn't ever exist because now I know what I'm missing. How great it felt to truly feel complete and like I was in the right path in my life for the first time, and now it's ripped away. One thing that has helped me is still talking to my son's spirit. I do not know you're view on the afterlife, but a friend recommended I watch a documentary called Surviving Death on Netflix. There is a segment with a medium and she talks about ppl never truly needing a medium, that or beloveds are always with us waiting for us to alsk them to communicate in their way. Or doing it without us even realizing. It sounds wild, but after talking to my son out loud and asking for him to respond or say hi I began to feel the smallest bit of relief in my heart. Just getting it out for him to hear and know (if he can) is it's own form of release. But it felt even better when I started picking up little signs and mementoes that could possibly be confirmation bias or could be him responding in his own way. Maybe giving it a try without harboring certain direct expectations, might help you process or work thru some harder conflicts or roadblocks in your head. Just speaking out loud to her, might make you feel slightly grounded in such a murky and cloudy time in your life. If nothing else, She might still have the ability to put you in a safe space that calms your nervous system even without truly being here. You're mind knows pathways like we know certain back roads. Sometimes you just have to help it find the entrance. And if you find her responding in ways only she would or you feel her presence with you, those are beautiful bonuses. Nothing can emulate her really being here, but know that you're so strong. Stronger than you think n this moment. And you'll succeed in raising your son in a way she would be proud of. I can tell that much just because you carry the concern that you might not. I hope you have a support system that keeps you sturdy throughout your journey of fatherhood. And remember to hold patience close to your heart, especially with yourself.",
      "I am no expert, only have one 2 year old myself, but my heart breaks for you. That's beyond unfair what happened to your wife, and I cannot imagine your pain. But I can tell you that your son will bring such joy to your life. Being a parent is hard so please make sure you have someone or a few people that you can rely on for help, but the joy your son will bring you will make it all worth it. Always lead with love, and try to be present in every moment as much as you can. You may not believe me, but YOU CAN DO THIS. If you know you love your little boy, then that's all I need to know that YOU CAN DO THIS. You will find strength and willpower you never knew you had while raising your son, and I pray you find all the help, guidance, support, and love that you can. Keep your head up. Don't give up. Lead with love."

      "Something I didn\u2019t expect but I really like about having a baby is how interested and excited other people are to see her, give her compliments, and chat about babies. I understand some people don\u2019t like making small talk with strangers and usually I am like that as well, but it\u2019s something I\u2019ve actually really appreciated, especially when I\u2019m not interacting with as many people as I used to before being on maternity leave. I\u2019ve had some really sweet individual interactions. I agree, engaging is a natural response to seeing a cute little baby and I like being able to take a minute to stop and let people take a look, pinch her little toes etc if it brightens their day. I also think it\u2019s good for baby\u2019s socialization.",
      "Literally nothing makes my day like my baby (and I guess me by proxy) making some older person\u2019s day. She\u2019s so smiley and these days loves to wave at everyone. I joke that it\u2019s like going out with a celebrity because of all the attention, but she loves it. Infancy is so so short. I love sharing this time with others. I wish my grandmother was still alive, both to meet my daughter and also because she was in a nursing home for many years and we loved to visit with our dog and say hi to the other residents (who absolutely loved it). It would be wonderful to be able to take my daughter around and bring some smiles to people who need them.",
      "I have only had positive experiences, either people smile at baby and talk to me about her or they pull faces at her from across a room and she is totally extroverted so she loves the attention and grins back at them. I have to say I have never had a stranger try touch my baby they look / interact but don\u2019t touch, maybe New Zealanders are just more polite I don\u2019t know. I also haven\u2019t read any of the stories you are referring too but I certainly wouldn\u2019t react like that, I would either be okay with it or politely say something to the effect of don\u2019t touch bubba lol. Honestly the smiles and interactions with older people are lovely and I think talking really makes their day, I think they are quite lonely and so am I atm!

We sat and talked for about an hour before they left. I don\u2019t mind looking at my baby, but touching makes me nervous. With RSV, the flu and cold/covid a little worse than normal for the season, I don\u2019t want her getting sick. I\u2019m only throwing hands if you try to pick her up. Don\u2019t do that. Touch her feet all you want, I can wash those.",
      "I get the instinct, but I also just ended up in reality, basing it on a case by case basis. Is it cold and flu season? Do the person's hands look clean? How is their demeanor?

Most of the time, if I don't want someone to touch my son, I physically move him away from them without saying anything.",

      "It frustrates me, as someone who HAS been violated (and never by a stranger), that's social media has latched on to terms like boundaries, consent, violate, and bodily autonomy, to foment fear for likes/follows/upvotes. That is not boomer-speak; that is actual victim-speak. There is a very real difference between an elderly (or not) stranger touching a child's arm/toes/head/cheek and a predator grooming a child through ongoing indoctrination. Treating every interaction as the latter and throwing around hot-button, social media terms to justify it, deminishes the power and meaning of those terms to help support and educate actual victims. By all means, empower children to recognize inappropriate behavior and advocate for themselves by saying NO, STOP, and telling trusted adult; all children should feel safe doing that! Teaching your child to be fearful and overreact to any contact by someone unknown to them isn't protecting them like you think it is. It's merely paying forward your social-media fueled (most likely unwarranted) anxiety and ensuring they either live with that anxiety or spend a lifetime overcoming it."

      "I breastfed my childhood friend\u2019s 6 month old daughter today. My 6 month old son and I went over to her house for a play date. When it came time for her bottle she drank maybe an ounce, and immediately projectile vomited across the room. My friend broke down bawling and told me the only formula she could find was a brand her daughter could not properly digest. Every single store she went to had little to no formula, even the off brand. She bought what she could find knowing it may upset her daughters stomach, but in hopes that maybe she could stomach enough until she could find her normal formula, or at least another brand that is similar. She even went to order some on Amazon but they\u2019re also months backed up. So, I offered to breast feed her daughter. Babies got to eat, and her daughter was clearly in distress and very hungry. She asked me if I was serious and I told her hell yeah because I\u2019ve got two breasts full of milk and I would be glad to feed two babies. So she told me we could give it a shot. It was a success. She ate until she was satisfied and fell asleep. No more distress. No throwing up. Just a satisfied sweet baby. We found some resources that may help her find some samples of formula until she can order or find more. Until then I also gave her my entire milk stash, and I\u2019m going to start watching her baby girl, instead of her attending daycare, so I can breast feed her LO while she\u2019s at work. I never thought I would see the day where I would need to breast feed someone else\u2019s baby because of a formula crisis. This is such a terrifying time. I am honestly so thankful that I was able to help. I wish I could do more, and help more parents. I can\u2019t imagine the fear that all these mama\u2019s and daddies who need formula for their babies are feeling. The fear of not being able to find their child\u2019s food\u2026 And the NICU\u2026the hospitals have also been having a hard time getting formula for the babies in the NICU. This is not right. People need to feed their babies and I feel like nothing is being done about this formula shortage!",
      "Let me guess, they voted it down and said something like, \"We do support helping parents get better access to formula, but this bill doesn't do it in the right way (something preachy about government spending or unnecessary increase of rules, or some other \"big government\" thing proably). We need to create a better solution for this so let's get to work!\" Then they turned around and did absolutely nothing, because in reality anything that could be done would be against the interests of republican corporate donors.",
      "I\u2019m seeing a lot of discussion in this thread and some people saying this bill does nothing but adds bloat to the FDA. According to Reuters, this is what the bill will do: The funds would provide the FDA with the resources to prevent fraudulent products from being placed on shelves. They would also be used to strengthen the FDA's workforce focused on formula issues and increase inspection staff. The FDA currently did not have an adequate inspection force to approve more baby formula companies whether domestically or internationally in a timely way. They had 9 people total able to do this. This bills was designed to work in tandem with the first one to speed up imports. Apparently Republicans are introducing a bill that asks Biden to invoke Defense Production Act (which I agree should be done, but am not sure how since there aren\u2019t many factories here that are capable and ready to make formula) and also waive FDA review for any formula already for sale in the EU (probably a good move). ETA: Quick edit for accuracy here \u2014 Republicans introduced their bill on Monday and Biden invoked DPA soon after.",

      "Honestly the whole fucking system needs to go. We need to have random elections for 6 months in government. If your eligible and able to vote and you are registered your name goes in a raffle with everyone else from your county your county goes in a state raffle we select by chance people who would get pulled in to vote only for 6 months. Give them a per diam their monthly salary plus like 2000 tops for food and living. A room would be rented but if they chose something else it would be on them to make sure it\u2019s within their price range. Gonna be kinda hard to pay people off if they\u2019re always changing. Just working class people helping other working class people. Also the ability to return to work. No time off taken."

      "So the problem is that we have a monopoly in the formula industry by four companies who control 98% of all productions. Two of those companies control almost all of the USA baby formula production. Abbott shutting down means we lost 43% of our production. So why don\u2019t we just import from Mexico or Canada? Their shelves are stocked full of baby formula! https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTdtYtt9T/?k=1 We\u2019ll see this thing happened when our former Republican President and King of the MAGA hat wearing cultists decided NAFTA was not a good thing. So Trump destroyed NAFTA I\u2019m 2018 an article was even written before NAFTA end that baby formula shortage could happen: https://www.thestar.com/business/opinion/2018/06/15/how-baby-formula-may-end-up-as-collateral-damage-in-trumps-nafta-war.html When Trump replaced NAFTA with the USMCA it placed policies that have kept Canadian milk out of the USA and levied an almost 20% tariff on baby formula with other duties above a certain volume that can increased the tariff to astronomical amounts making it undesirable for Canada, Mexico or other countries to import baby formula. This has left the USA at the mercy of the baby formula monopoly of two single corporations to make baby formula. This is what happens when people fail to actually follow what\u2019s happening they lack the simple knowledge required to understand domestic policies and why bad things happen. Then they blame Joe Biden with their little \u201cLet\u2019s Go Brandon\u201d think they are soooooo smart and funny and vote for the same morons who keep fleecing the American people.

      "These posts always make me sad as well. I live abroad and don't speak the language so often time people who try to engage with my child will just continue on their way once they're aware of the language barrier. But my toddler is so friendly and smiley and it's really sweet to see the way he lights people up and vice versa. I haven't had a lot of people trying to touch him, but I think the interactions with strangers are super cute. The other day on the tram he was facing me in his stroller playing peekaboo with a stranger sitting behind us. As we got off I looked to see who was making my son giggle and it was this guy with face tattoos and a pretty tough-guy outfit but he had a super friendly smile and he just looked delighted to be making a kid laugh.",
      "Yes, I cannot agree more on the cultural aspect! It\u2019s very common to touch and hold other people\u2019s babies in my culture too. That said, I\u2019ve found my generation does have more boundaries, and I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised by how well the older generation has responded to these limits when enforced as gently and respectfully as possible. Currently, my family is on vacation in Portugal and so many older people have touched my daughter\u2019s hand or head, always very sweetly, and it\u2019s been unexpectedly heartwarming to me... Admittedly, I don\u2019t like it at home either, so I\u2019m not disagreeing with parents having limits, but I tend to have a more laidback personality on vacation (I\u2019m a super anxious person at home), plus it helps that my daughter\u2019s a bit older now (13 months) and has more vaccinations to help protect her. Anyway, I\u2019ve found a lot of the interactions endearing. It\u2019s so nice to see a society wholeheartedly enjoy children instead of finding them a nuisance.",
      "I'm raising my baby across the country from my family. I've lost both my grandparents. I personally embrace these interactions for my baby. I have had elderly women reach out to touch her. But it's not frequently and if I wasn't comfortable, I'd interfere with the attempt with kindness. In the last week, I had one elderly women fawn over my baby and say how she wishes she was her Nana (she kept her hands to herself). I will often prompt my baby to wave or help her to wave. I'm typically wearing my baby so no one gets too close to my baby with9ut also entering my own personal space. I think my baby benefits from these social interactions and also, I love seeing how it lights up these strangers faces. So often seniors are so isolated and lonely. Babies are such a gift and I love being able to share these moments. I think some people are a bit extreme in their responses but everyone gets to choose what they feel comfortable with for their baby. I do hope people handle this with kindness though as, for the most part, there is no ill intent behind these gestures. I've only had one encounter that made me uncomfortable and it was at a family gathering where my MIL was holding my newborn and a distant aunt reached out and traced her fingers over my babies face, over her eyebrows etc. It still enrages me. Anyways - I guess my experience is a mixed bag but I mostly find my experiences to be positive and something to be embraced.",
      "Agree. 100%. I made a comment on that post, it probably was way down but it makes me happy to interact with the old ladies, my son brightens their day and in turn that makes me feel good. We evolved to live in tribes not so isolated, some days those interactions are my only ones and I cherish them. Think babies are so cute so people would notice them and help us out!",
      "I didn\u2019t see this post, but wow!! I love taking my baby to the grocery store specifically for this reason; it\u2019s wonderful to mingle with seniors and hear their stories. Every time we go I get to watch someone light-up when seeing my son, and I\u2019m well aware these folks are often, sadly, isolated and alone. That post sounds like a cringy western super mom kinda thing\u2026ick. Anyway thanks for this thread! It seems to have resonated with quite a few people \ud83e\ude75"

      ">I think we as millennials are losing our sense of humanity and community in parenthood. SPOT. ON. Our generation of parents have a toxic streak all our own. Nobody touch my baby ever! My child will never attend a sleepover! Daycare is evil! The moment my kid catches a cold is the moment I\u2019ve failed as a parent! My child will never even see a television until they\u2019re twelve! Every moment you don\u2019t spend enriching and entertaining your kid for every moment of every day is a failure! Such neglect! Millennials are the worst generation of helicopters that ever lived. We bubble wrap our kids, never give them a moment to themselves, we\u2019re hyper vigilant, we assume there\u2019s sex predators around every corner, and we\u2019re obnoxiously pious about our parenting styles. Many parents of this generation are A) overcorrect for their parents\u2019 mistakes, and B) trying to live up to obnoxious mommy influencers on Instagram. We have all collectively got to step back and let our kids be their own people to an extent. This whole \u201chyper obsessive optimal parent\u201d trend has got to go.",
      "That post was insane, and I find it really concerning how popular that mindset is, especially when you pair it with how often people are complaining about being lonely or not having a village nowadays. Reddit: Set all the boundaries and enforce them at any costs! Anyone who disrespects them is a monster who must be cut off! Someone pissed you off? Cut them off immediately! Someone disagreed with you? Cut them off! Take no shit! You don't owe anyone anything! Anyone who questions you is a toxic narcissist! Anyone who wants to say hi to your kid in the grocery store is a pedophile! Anyone who looks at your kid funny deserves a beat down! Fuck everyone except for my kid and maybe my partner! Also Reddit: I have no family and no friends and no one to help me with my kid, I'm lonelier than I've ever been since having my baby, no one is coming to my kid's birthday party, and my kid isn't getting included in any playgroups because the other moms are all toxic.

      "People have gone freaking nuts about germs since covid. These sorts of people will end up raising kids who are OCD germaphobes which is really sad for the kids. Before I get down voted, I believe in Covid, and I believed in taking precautions during the pandemic but I think we need to move past it now. Sometimes you have to weigh up the risks against the negative impact of the precautions. For example, tiny risk that your child might pick up a bug from someone, versus pretty high risk that they will grow up terrified of touching anyone or thing that hasn't been sanitised.",
      "I think that poster was disgusting, to be honest. I think there were some anger or severe anxiety (or both) issues going on there. But I didn't want to start an argument, so I left it. Do I want all the old ladies in the town touching my baby? No. But old people are the least likely to be hanging out in nightclub orgies or at playgroups with lots of grimey children, so if there is going to be a demographic that I let touch my kid, it'll be them. And if one old lady is particularly taken with my baby, fine. I'll let her reminisce about her grown children with my little one. It's harming no one. Some people just think it's okay to be enormous assholes under the guise of 'protecting my kid'. There are ways to do that without assaulting the elderly.",
      "I don\u2019t understand why every post or comment on this topic of strangers interacting with a baby has to be so extreme. I think it\u2019s a little bit ridiculous to say that people don\u2019t have a village because they don\u2019t let strangers touch their baby. And I also think it\u2019s ridiculous that people think because someone is old they can\u2019t be harmful or dangerous. Strangers should not be reaching out to strangers at all and before anyone comes for me I am West African we\u2019re bih a village raises a child, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you have no boundaries or limits with anyone you come into contact with. At the end of the day we should all be respectful of one another whether we are elderly or babies. When you decide to violate someone\u2019s personal space unfortunately you do open yourself up to being reprimanded and something may even be cultural but culture also needs to evolve and change it\u2019s not stagnant."

      "Servers are oddly (but pleasantly) affectionate. Cheek nuzzles, kisses, hand holding and hiney pats are always offered. Sometimes the male server gives food that is a little cold, definitely would recommend female server instead. She also smells better. Always a safe place for a post or mid meal nap - the owners are forever on the lookout of their patrons safety. Also, the fluffy mascot will sometimes keep me company, especially at night. I enjoy the company as with the pandemic and all I have not had any play dates, so I have loads of time to kill between meals. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50",
      "I dine at my local Breastaurant 5-10 times daily. I always get the daily special of Milks for my Belly; and it is consistently refreshing and filling. The staff has finally learned to cater to my ever changing arrangements, as sometimes I prefer to start my meal on the right side of the Breastaurant, before switching to the left, and occasionally I will return to the right for dessert. My favorite service is the evening dine in event - as it comes with a luxurious spa treatment, including bubble bath, followed by a relaxing massage, and finishing up with a pair of warm jammies that are just my size. I must admit, much to my disappointment, I find the late night options quite unsatisfactory in that I must dine in utter darkness. The staff isn't as speedy with the Milks after approximately 10pm, and always seems to focus on some light emitting device they refuse to let me look at. I suppose it's an industry secret - but as I am their best customer I feel I am entitled to at least a glance. Overall, I believe I will continue with the meal service here. The Milks specials are always pleasant, the spa treatments excellent, but the staff does leave something to be desired. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50",

I give it 3 stars for the magic trick though. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 I've heard the nearby restaurant Bottlefeed has a much faster and constant flow of servings (although ordering takes much longer due to heating of the food). Breastaurant staff sometimes prevents me from accessing this preferred food option for selfish reasons claiming they might close if I refuse to dine there. \u2b50 Waitress delays serving me food claiming me ordering made her thirsty.

I was amazed at how thoughtful and brave you were amidst everything you were going through. I am so sorry for your loss, and I am so glad to hear your update and to know a community is supporting you - in real life and virtually. Your son is so lucky to have you as a father, and I know you will be such a good role model for him growing up. I wish your wife was with you physically, but I believe she is with you in spirit and with her love. And of course, she will always be with you because she lives on in your son. Please do find the support you need to work through your own grief/thoughts/emotions when you feel able. Your son needs his father to take care of himself as well. Don't feel bad about letting your guard down and feeling what you need to feel tomorrow. Sometimes, just letting it out can be therapeutic on its own. It hurts, but it helps heal you a little every time. I just lost my mom, and I find I feel better after a good cry, even though it scares me to let my feelings in. You spend so long being strong that it can be hard to be vulnerable. But there is a time for both, and you were strong when you needed to be, so please don't feel bad for letting yourself grieve when you are able to.

      "I love this! I do psycholinguistics research/speech language therapy with kids. I think it's important to stress that reading is great because of the things you mentioned....knowing how books work, turning pages, desire/interest in reading. This is my long, unasked for soapbox: I will in no way ever tell a parent not to read to their kid, but.... There is no evidence that kids learn vocabulary/grammar from books MORE THAN other activities where you introduce new words and interact with your kid. The research people cite when telling parents to read to their kids simply tells them that kids can learn vocabulary from reading (and these studies are all so different it's hard to compare meaningfully). There's a meta analysis out there (Wasik, 2016 or 2017) showing that kids will learn the same amount of vocabulary when you're playing with them and use the same words. Studies looking at actually learning grammar from kids books are extremely rare. And any gain in reading skills is MINIMAL unless you are actively teaching them how to read on a regular basis (e.g. identifying letters, having them help sound out words) This is really important to me - I've worked with many non literate parents who feel so ashamed that they don't read to their kids, or parents who don't speak English, but want their kids to speak English, so only keep English kids books in the house that the parents can't read. You can help your kid just as much in language by making a vocabulary list for a specific activity you're doing and see how many of those you can incorporate into playing. Make it a game. Kids learn best when they feel safe and supported and connected to others in a social interaction. If that's reading for you, great! But don't beat yourself up for not doing it every day. I read to my kids every day because I want them to love reading. For language skills, I interact in meaningful and positive ways with them and try to thinking of \"fancy\" words and synonyms they might not know as we are playing. Or try rewording what I'm saying once in a while.",
      "I love this thread! OP I can just hear the sheer joy as your reading journey with baby paid off, proud of your perseverance. Previously a nursery practitioner and reading to children was so amazing and soothing especially when the little ones learnt small phrases. I\u2019d pause and allow them to make the sound or phrases, their anticipation to books were amazing and knowing when to turn pages. Every time I read to them I couldn\u2019t wait to read to my own someday. I mainly read in school from young , as I loved learning reading was my go to for information and entertainment. It\u2019s such an important skill and past time to share with others. At the moment I\u2019m looking at books from black authors to add to the vast collection of already popular and brilliant books; I\u2019m so eager to buy and eventually go to the library.",
      "Idk why but it this made me so emotional to read and then to read all the comments of parents reading to their babies \ud83e\udd79 I\u2019ve been reading to my son since he was a literal newborn. Like day 3 of life lol. And we never skip a night. Even if we are away for the night and he\u2019s staying with a grandparent, we pack books for them to read to him. We also gave all the grandparents special books for Christmas to read with him. My husband is a special Ed teacher and I\u2019m a social worker so we have had it ingrained to read to him every night. He\u2019s 10 months old now and when he\u2019s playing in his room while we are cooking or cleaning we will leave a bunch of toys out for him to stay entertained. Without fail he flips through books and pulls books off his bookshelf to look at and inspect every.single.time he will choose books over toys. It\u2019s just the most amazing thing to see. Also, whenever we go someone his \u201csouvenir\u201d is always a special book from that place. It\u2019s my fav tradition \u2764\ufe0f keep reading to your babies",
      "This has been my experience too! I read to my baby every single day, even before he was born. Initially it was just a thing to do, something to kill time and feel like you're doing something productive. From about 8 months old, he started to show a real love for books. Like reacting to the stories by making sounds, reaching out to touch the texture books and the lift the flap ones. We go to the library every week and he picks out 5 new ones. At home he is constantly pulling books out of the bookshelf and bringing them over to us to read to him (sometimes pretty forcefully!). He will have a favourite book for a week that he just wants you to read over and over and over. He turned the pages for you and would anticipate what the upcoming pages would say (like making the relevant noise). Plus I'm really starting to see educational value. Now he's 11 months old, it's clear he's learnt certain words from books, like if a book says \"kiss\" he'll immediately smooch the book or me, or if it says \"hello/goodbye\" he'll wave! He's started to make associations too like one of our books is about a rabbit and he went to grab his stuffed toy rabbit whilst we were reading about the rabbit in the book! I can point to certain animals in books and he'll make their noise too. He also \"reads\" certain books independently, like he'll grab a lift the flap book and just sit, flick through the pages and flaps and be pretty content. Honestly it's probably my favourite activity to do with him!",
      "Our son is a little over 12 months and is at the same stage as your baby. Loves books, turns the pages, brings us his favorites, has us read them to him over and over, and is even soothed by books when cranky. We did the same thing that you did \u2014 read to him consistently since he was a newborn. Had books in all the play areas so he viewed them the same as toys, fun and engaging. Read him a set rotation of books every night. His favorites at the moment are Brown Bear Brown Bear, Chicka Chicka Boom Boom, Guess How Much I Love You, a Sesame Street version of Wheels on the Bus and an Elmo Simon Says book. I\u2019m so glad that we stuck with it and created this strong foundation of reading and literacy for him. It\u2019s so important and sets them up for success in school and also life."

      "Big time. My son was born at 27 weeks. I sang and read to him since he was 2lb 3oz baby. So many fears surrounded him and speech delay was one of them\u2026. He\u2019s 27 months now and scores as a 4 year old kid in speech and I know it was because of all the reading those stupid books and talking to him",

      "I try to read to my LO once a day, but I'll admit I don't always meet that quota. She doesn't seem to like the reading time. She grabs the book to throw it and starts whinging and crying too and wants to be let go",
      "I am dyslexic but I can read quite fast because my mother read to me starting when I was an infant. She would also point out the words to me while she read. It caused my brain to compensate for the dyslexia by viewing words as shapes not strings of letters. I figured this out in college when I had a teacher who wrote in all caps and I had so much trouble reading his writing."

      "It was definitely a tough year. We finally conceive our rainbow baby in mid-March after infertility treatment. I was told I am the last patient they have since covid was getting worse and they will discontinue temporarily taking on more patients. Then came April, they laid off 250 people in our company. Luckily I was saved and kept working but reduced hours. With uncertainly with healthy insurance and income, it\u2019s been so stressful. My husband never was able to go to any of my ultrasounds, only saw through pictures and videos I took. I got diagnosed with gestational diabetes and hypertension and it\u2019s been a rough road. Then came November, they laid off another 50 people. But I was saved mostly due to going on maternity leave. This baby is our good luck charm, we are so blessed.

      "Our little girl is due any day and this post hits me hard. I feel so much pride for my partner going through this pregnancy during the pandemic and she's so strong. There has been tears for missing family but she's been incredible. But it's also hitting me hard that this image has no picture including the partners. I haven't been allowed into any of our scans , had very little communication or involvement with midwives etc despite request. I've been doing everything I can to prepare the house, building furniture, cleaning, taking care of the dog, cooking etc and I don't want or feel I need any praise for that as I'm happy to do my part, but I do sometimes feel that partners of pregnant women are often not taken into inconsideration particularly during this pandemic. There are alot of men for example who do not get involved especially stereotypical men, but we live in a time where this is less common and men want to be heard, want to be involved and appreciated and I am and have been sensitive and emotional during this time as well. Suppose I just feel I have no real support or guidance, and the majority of information and support is geared towards women. Anyways, that's my two cents, sorry for the long reply",
      "We had our first child at the end of August. I was devastated to have had a taste of pregnancy pre- pandemic and then have it taken away. While prenatal yoga, going to appointments together, baby showers and general celebration together was taken away we've gained so much. I'm a nurse but my husband is wfh and watches our baby as well. If it wasn't a pandemic neither of us would see him the majority of the day. I love it being just the 3 of us. I know we're both exhausted but it's so great for our boy to have this close bond with both parents. I feel bad our families can't have a physical closeness with him, but we isolate now so we can gather later. Thankful for our health and jobs. \ud83e\udd17",

      "I had my son in august. It was such a weird roller coaster. I got maybe a month or pre pandemic already announced pregnancy. My husband came to the first and 2nd appointments. After that it was just me, which honestly wasn\u2019t a huge deal, it\u2019s just a drs appointment and they are fairly uneventful. It was a little upsetting he couldn\u2019t come to the anatomy scan but really worse things could happen and were happening all around us. But it was kinda nice it just being us in the hospital. It wasn\u2019t stressful and we just got to bond with our new baby. We came home and we didn\u2019t have a million people trying to touch him and come over unexpectedly. A lot of things sucked about being pregnant and having our baby in the pandemic, and we honestly thought it would be over by the time we had him when it first hit. That was the saddest realization that he was going to be born into this weird confusing time. Not very many people have met my son which makes me sad sometimes, but I also don\u2019t have to worry about the flu, or rsv, or any other illness that can easily make a baby really sick. He\u2019s safe at home with me. It is incredibly frustrating to have been so careful for so long and it feels like everyone else is out living their best lives. They can\u2019t be mad about another shut down when they are the reason we have to shut down again.",

      ">I\u2019ve learned that one of the most helpful things I can do is ask my wife while she\u2019s feeding or playing with our daughter, \u201cis there anything in particular that you need done?\u201d Hmmm, this is better than sitting around waiting to be told. But I would say that if we're trying to be co-parents we *shouldn't need to ask*! As co-parents we can see when the dishwasher needs emptying or the laundry needs doing, or the bottles need sterilising just as well as our partner can. Requiring her to tell us what to do isn't actually all that great since it puts extra mental load on her when its unnecessary. >Be active in out-of-home care This is good advice. We should be making sure that doctors, day-care etc. have our phone numbers as well as mums', and even that our numbers are ahead of hers on their list of contacts sometimes to take responsibility for fielding certain phone calls. I've made sure that while my wife manages the doctors, I'm the primary contact for our daycare. We should also be active in arranging play-dates and trips out for the weekend as well. >You\u2019re not the only one working Absolutely. This is essential advice. I took three months off for paternity leave during our LO's first year, and beleive me, I enjoyed it but it was *exhausting*. In some ways work is a lot easier and less mentally and emotionally draining than child care. >you should know how to take care of your baby completely absent from your partner Yes! This x1000.

      "My husband is an imperfect human like all of us, but two things he does great as a dad... we normally do shifts but when we have a rough sleep week, at least 1 night a week he takes the baby and lets me get a full night. He told me he actually loves daddy nights, bonding with his daughter, and occasionally getting more sleep out of her than i do lol. When i was nursing and not pumping, he would bring her to me, nurse her side laying, and take her back when she or i fell asleep. On weekends, we each have a day where we are the primary parent. Now that i pump, i can do whatever with my day \"off\". This also has resulted in my husband being an actual competent parent since he figured out pretty quick how to change her, nap her, feed her, warm a bottle, entertain, etc. When he first went back to work and baby was much needier, he did all the chores. I also have never had to deal with any baby paperwork, he took care of her SSN, birth certificate, etc. Now that i pump and nurse, he \"places a milk order\" every morning for night feeding and makes up her bottles. Ive literally never bottle fed my 4mo old.",

      "I have a 14 year old daughter, her dad prioritised work (chef) over his relationship with both of us I practically raised her solo, he wasn't a bad guy and has always been their to help financially but he would literally come home from a long day and then \"unwind\" with hours of gaming we lasted 5 yrs in total 3 with my daughter. Last year I fell pregnant to my current partner, and although a completely different relationship I was petrified I'd be left in the same situation, he works 12 hour overnight shifts and is also a gamer so to me the probability was high. My partner knew my concerns and promised it would be different, I trusted his word but deep down I was still scared. He lived up to every single promise he made, after the birth of our beautiful daughter who unfortunately had some breathing complications he didn't leave my side, he took a month off work, because of his overnight shifts, days he doesn't work he has her from midnight till 7am so I can sleep, he changes her, feeds her, does housework and helps me as much as he can. I suffered from pretty bad post natal depression, he will let me nap and help me to remember my meds and talks to me often about my fears and concerns. If your a new dad please help your partner, pregnancy is hard, labour is hard both physically and mentally. My 14 yr old has no respect and no love for her bio dad, she also suffers from and depression and anxiety partially due to him abandoning her over and over. I can promise if you don't help out or you disregard your partner for your own selfish wants and desires constantly you will loose your kids. He regrets and sadly still tries to hold onto both of us and tbh I actually feel sorry for him, he has is work (which he hates) lives with his dad (who he also hates) and sees me and his daughter sparodically because she now can't be bothered with him I'm so blessed to have an amazing partner now, he's currently fawning over her after he fed her.

Maybe making that decision when so exhausted isn't ideal, but those ladies are done. You grew up in patriarchy and the things you were taught about women, marriage, and parenting are literally toxic. Work to undo that before you're single again.",

I'm working on your baby-free errands tip. It's hard for me not to just jump in the car and go out when we need something.",
      "Then there are those \"dads\" that can't stand their baby's cry or don't want the baby to sleep in the same room with them, don't want the wife to breastfeed and then go further to repeatedly call their wives lazy for \"adding too much weight.\" Listen cocksuckers, from the moment the baby is born you're clocked in. There's no clocking out. You MUST be selfless,considerate and caring for both baby and wife. Don't sit on your sorry ass and wait to be told what to do. You know what needs to be done. When your wife is doing one thing for baby you should be doing the other. And one more thing, she carried and nurtured a whole human being in her belly for months, the whole time she ate for two and successfully delivered through unimaginable labour pains. So STFU about her weight. It's the last thing you should be worried about right now."

      "I remember a lot of that part of Britney Spears\u2019 life, too. I was a kid at the time and I believed a lot of it. Used to make fun of her like everyone else. With all that we know now, I think the \u201cLeave Britney Alone\u201d fan had it right. I don\u2019t know everything about her or her fitness as a mom, but I agree it would\u2019ve been for best if people had left her alone. She was going through a lot - she needed help, not harassment disguised as \u201cjokes\u201d and the media\u2019s nose in business constantly.",
      "Looking at that pic now makes me think of myself about 16 months ago - I had a newborn and a 13mo in the pediatricians office, by myself (husband had to work) and I was in the lobby when they both had simultaneous meltdowns. I didn\u2019t know which one to comfort first or how to comfort both at the same time so I just started crying too (the baby blues hit me HARD). The world\u2019s sweetest nurse came out, grabbed my toddler and whisked us into a patient room. She told me, I\u2019ll never forget, \u201cI promise mama, it gets so much easier. It\u2019s hard now but it will get better.\u201d In the sweetest voice. That nurse saved me that day. I wish we as a society had done the same for Britney back then. That\u2019s all she needed, was kind words and support.",

The best way I\u2019ve learned to cope with all my new emotions is to just be kinder to everyone I see, especially moms and their kids. You won\u2019t catch me side eyeing a meltdown in a restaurant or anything anymore. I also try to text my mom friends to check on them more.",

      "I\u2019m not discounting that something could be affecting your wife, but from your comments about your wife being like this before baby, it sounds like she just doesn\u2019t like certain responsibilities and she is choosing what she wants to do and what she doesn\u2019t. It sounds incredibly narcissistic and self-absorbed. You\u2019ve always been the one taking care of her, has she ever had to take care of another person? Or even reciprocate what you do for her? I would work on finding the right nanny to help you offload some of your daughter\u2019s care while you figure out what you want to do. No one gets to be a fair weather parent- you can\u2019t play with and enjoy your kid but when it comes to taking care of them, say no thanks and refuse to do it. I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t have a partner who is concerned about what you are going through as a result of their refusal to be a teammate.",
      "Ditch the wife, marry the nanny lol That\u2019s a funny take on it but for sure your wife needs some form help (therapy and a reality check.) If you\u2019ve reached your wits end, which seems like you have, I\u2019d say you and your daughter are better off without her. Get out of there buddy. And make sure you get full custody.",
      "This is a sad situation for everyone involved. Maybe your wife needs a bit of help with her post partum/new mum feelings. I\u2019m 10 months in and still feel myself pulling away at times it doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t live my son wholeheartedly but it\u2019s a huge change and I was/am blindsided. I\u2019m getting help and take space when I need it. My partner is also incredibly supportive, emotionally and practically. I wish you all the best",
      "I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re struggling with this. I don\u2019t have advice but you sound like a really great, loving dad. I hope you are able to work through this with your wife.",
      "Hey bud, sorry to hear about your situation. This might seem stupid but what was the plan supposed to be like when you first started talking about parenting duties? I really don't have all the context needed to give a more personalized answer but speaking as someone who became a parent a year ago, realize that there are a lot of changes happening within your wife, hormonally and emotionally. Whether women like it or not, they are no longer who they used to be and now have to refigure who is the person that is staring back at them in the mirror. Plus marriage isn't always 50/50. Some days you have to put in more effort than your partner and vice versa. I think before losing faith in your wife you should talk to her about your feelings, in a way that she will understand. And also see how she is doing? She might be struggling/need some help. Good luck"

      "Your wife may have untreated postpartum depression. It doesn\u2019t always look like crying and sadness, a lot of it is avoidance impatient and disinterested behavior. There might be even resentment towards the child and you. She absolutely needs a therapist. Yeah, she could just be that selfish, and then that also means she needs therapy because the damage to your child for being rejected by her own mother will be bad. Get her to see her behavior isn\u2019t normal.",
      "Late to the game here, but if you've ruled out post-partum depression, it might just be that she's taking advantage of the situation. You gave an inch and she's taking a mile. Why would she deal with being frustrated when she has someone who will handle it for her? What would she do if you made her deal with the tantrum? Would she abuse your daughter? Not feed her? Or would she power through, make it work, and then maybe cry afterwards? If it's the latter, tough love might be the solution. \"Oops, you have to start feeding her in the evenings since I'm behind on work.\" Essentially train some endurance and fortitude into your wife little by little.",
      "Was she like this when you married her? I don\u2019t really have a good defense for her behavior at ALL. It sounds wretched and I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s some depression or avoidance but you need to confront her and give her a damn ultimatum. I\u2019ll be **damned** if I\u2019m going to shirk my responsibilities to my husband and our son like this. Hell no.",
      "I have an understanding of this. My daughter is 9 months and my wife has until fairly recently shyed away from most childcare. Not to your parents extent. But we discussed it as a result of her traumic experience since childbirth. Unable to breastfeed, terrible insomnia, postpartum depression. The way we're handling it though is by going through it. We're working very hard at finding solutions. Getting mental health support and treatment. The communication is daily. We've gone through all the fears and feelings, both of us. My advice is to dive into it. Confront what is uncomfortable because you have now is not tenable. Did you have roles agreed to before you had the baby?",
      "Gosh, this hurts to read as a SAHM. Parenting is hard without working, even harder without the support of the other parent. If your wife is getting that frustrated over tantrums, it sounds like she may have some sensory processing issues she needs to work through with a professional. Even more, it's not sounding like she had any bonding time and is more focused on selfish needs instead of her child's needs. Feeding gets so much harder once they're on solids, no matter if you breast or bottle fed. I think you need to do what most people tell moms when the dad is minimally involved. Leave the house while she's home and force her to take care of and bond with that baby! There is no excuse for only one parent to be involved, regardless of how little or how much they work or provide for the household. You deserve a break, too."

The advice I got that was helpful: * Have dad set a reminder on his phone to take a picture of you at least once a day. Annoying that he should have to, and it doesn't always work, but it has improved. * Just suck it up, hand him your phone, and say, \"here this is cute, take a picture of us now.\" This has been the most effective, and it also reminds him that he ISN'T taking pictures when he could be.

Wealthy people founded this country to protect the wealthy - themselves - and the government they created granted them the power to overrule the people whenever they see fit. Back in the 1800s, Mark Twain said, \u201cWe have the best Congress money can buy.\u201d Nothing has changed in the power structure. The wealthy still call the shots and run things for their own benefit. The game is rigged, as it\u2019s always been, and the only chance we have to save our society for the people and the planet is to flip the board and very specifically create a society intentionally designed to meet the needs of the people and the planet. Wealthy \u201cowners\u201d have no place in this society. They do not have a right to hoard wealth created by our collective labor and the plundering of earth\u2019s resources. Those belong to us all, and we belong to each other. This vision of society is called socialism, and it works, despite all the capitalist propaganda that attempts to brainwash us to the contrary. Capitalism is inherently unstable and unsustainable, so it devolves into fascism, which holds the social order together by increasing amounts of brutality. As the social order devolves, however, it opens an opportunity not just for fascism and barbarism, but for socialism, for a new social order based on humanity, abundance, and justice. The good news is that there is a proven method for seizing such an opportunity and decisively taking political power for the people.

      "I feel this. My baby is almost 7 months old now but the transition to daycare at 4 months was terrible. Not only was I adjusting to returning to work as a first time mom, but we were all very sick for a couple months. Baby even ended up in the ICU once. It really is a terrible time.",
      "I go back in exactly 3 weeks (9 weeks maternity leave total) and I totally agree! Our short term disability pays us for 7 weeks at 60% of our wage and then our employer requires we use up our PTO to cover the additional 40% and any additional weeks we take off. So I basically had no choice but to limit my time off to 8-9weeks bc I will have zero PTO if I went for 12. I am SO worried about taking my 2 month old to daycare.. I just know she\u2019s going to get sick\u2026 and all this measles outbreak news has me in a panic since lil babies can\u2019t get the mmr shot till 1 yr :("

      "I\u2019ve been blessed with two easy babies. Neither really cried, both were(/are) super chill during the day and great sleepers at night. I\u2019m lucky. Incredibly lucky! Now that my older one is a toddler, he\u2019s definitely become a tornado. In my case, the baby phase each time has been \u201cthe calm before the storm\u201d of which I\u2019ve enjoyed immensely and have felt so grateful to experience in such a positive way. All babies are different, all parenting experiences are different. I\u2019m really glad you\u2019ve had a great journey so far and wish you all the best in the rollercoaster of parenthood that\u2019s yet to come! Phases and stages come in waves, some easy (some not), and if we are fortunate enough parenthood is able to challenge us and bring out the best in us. Keep up the positive attitude and keep enjoying the ride!",
      "My little girl who is 17m now was always very easy going and generally a very happy baby! It got difficult for me when she was 4 months cus her sleep just went out the window but it was just a phase that eventually passed - and she was still a happy easy going baby through the phase, she just decided to wake up all the time haha. She's still easy going, extremely loving and just the cutest thing ever! Love travelling with her, taking her out the house on adventures, staying in and doing cozy stuff... Don't let people bring you down \ud83e\udd70 enjoy your lovely baby \u2764\ufe0f",
      "It\u2019s so nice to see another happy parent here. Mine is 14 weeks and an absolute joy and a very easy baby (knock on wood). I wish everyone could have this experience. I recognize the privilege and luck that I have with this and am grateful for it. Not being able to nurse her has sucked and been such a grief-laden experience, but it\u2019s not her fault she has a tongue tie. She really is a wonderful baby and I hope our next one takes after her \u263a\ufe0f My heart goes out to parents whose babies are colicky or regularly fussy. I\u2019m so sorry that\u2019s happening and being their experience. I hope for all of them that toddlerhood brings some relief for them and baby. For those in that trench, you are amazing parents and deserving of so much praise and recognition, I can only imagine what that experience is like and you are incredibly resilient and strong for surviving it.",
      "Omg who are these Reddit monsters reminding your to repost in hopes you are miserable like them?? My first baby was an easy one too. The first year of his life was pretty magical. I feel forever grateful for that experience and wish for other mothers to have magical baby experiences too. They can happen. I\u2019ll never forget my first born never cried for more than 5 minutes. He was so easily settled. He\u2019s my best little bud as a kid now. My second\u2026not so easy. I did all the same things and the first year was very challenging and not peaceful at all. He\u2019s over a year now and becoming more content and interactive every day. Different stages for different kids will be challenging. Different stages for different kids will be hella rewarding and special. Enjoy the good times and know, when you experience a challenging time, there is going to be a good time around the corner. Nothing lasts forever. Sending you & your babe lots of love \ud83d\udc95",
      "Yeah, we got dealt a lucky hand too, at 3.5 months he's already 7-8 hours most nights, although he's kind of impossible to put down during the day. He's chill and not screaming the whole time or whatever, but he needs to be held to nap etc. Happy, healthy, yabba dabba doo. I haven't wanted to say this in other comments sections cause I dunno, seems kinda gauche, so thank you for creating a safe space to share how pleased and proud I am with my sweet lil lucky guy, ha. Congrats to you as well!"

      "This is me!!! This sub scared the s*** outta me and I lived in fear week after week anticipating \u201cthe regression\u201d and everything else I got warned about. My LO did wake every 3 hours at the beginning, but would eat and immediately go back to sleep. By 4 weeks, we started getting a 5-6 hour stretch. By 10 weeks, it was an 8-9 hours stretch. And by 5 months, we consistently got 12-13 hours every single night. At 6.5 months today, still no issues. I think people come to this sub when they are struggling, not when it\u2019s just going fine. So a lot of outliers here. I REALLY feel for those people because having a baby is HARD WORK even when they sleep at night and are generally not fussy. I can\u2019t even imagine living some of the stories I read here.",

It\u2019s just my coping mechanism to expect the worse so everything beyond that is just a relief \ud83d\ude02",

      "You grow up with your oldest kid, and you raise your younger ones. We just had our second baby and we found it much easier, too. Easier to handle, easier to enjoy, easier to recover from. I was really worried about that being the case and felt guilty at first\u2026 until I watched my 4 year-old son be the most loving, nurturing big brother. Grabbing his baby doll and modeling what I\u2019m doing with his sister, watching me and my husband so he knows what to do when he sees her bottle fall or binky drop (picks it up and puts them where he sees us put them), and comes running to tell us if he hears her crying in her bassinet. Your first got your blunders, but they got your time and love in a way the others won\u2019t. They\u2019ll feel pride in their role as the oldest and pass the love they feel from you on to their younger siblings. They watched you grow up for them, and now they\u2019ll do the same for their siblings. (Not to say you put them in a \u201cthird parent\u201d role; my husband is an older brother and has always loved his role as nurturer and instigator. He\u2019s always balanced embracing being a caregiver and a child at heart.) Use this to bond with your oldest and share this journey with them. Remind them what a great older sibling they are, guide them through the tough emotions and redirect them into positive behaviors, and always tell them they\u2019re your \u201cbig guy/big girl.\u201d I set aside time throughout the week that\u2019s just me and him time \u2014 cooking together, reading \u2014 and my husband does too \u2014 wrestling, gardening \u2014 and then we do family walks and backyard time all together. The fact that you even feel this in the first place shows how much love you have for your kids. I\u2019m sure your oldest feels it, and love is a ripple effect: you\u2019ll see them pass it on to their younger sibling in all the little ways you\u2019ve taught them to love.",

We get booted from the hospital with a whole new human and no instructions other than a nurse making sure there\u2019s a car seat installed before you go. Swaddling\u2026.I had to leave that to my husband, because I sure never got it right. He asked the hospital nurses so many times before we left to show him time and again. I\u2019m sure we were annoying to the staff, but we had no clue what we were going and it was scary. I think feeling like we\u2019re failing as mothers is a natural instinct, because that was ALL I felt. My husband was my champion, telling me I was doing awesome, but it never reached my heart and felt true. It was like having imposter syndrome for the longest time for so many things; Breastfeeding, formula feeding, when to start solids, am I reading enough to them, when to potty train, how long potty training is taking\u2026etc\u2026 I\u2019m only now coming out of that feeling and my LO just turned 4. I still feel like I\u2019m still probably lacking on so many fronts with her, but the major milestones are over and she\u2019s entering the kid phase. I can\u2019t have a 2nd child, so all I can do is be here and give her my time & love and hope it all works out and that she still loves me when she\u2019s older.",

I was 21 when I had my daughter and 32 when I had my son, it's not just about what I learned as a parent in the last 10 years but also how much I've grown up and my priorities have shifted. How much more patient I am with him than I was with her. Now that I have him I realize how much time I spent trying to get her to sleep alone when all she wanted was to be with me. I think about how her colic, may have just be me not understanding her needs. I think about how I worked so hard for my career so I could provide for my daughter and my son will never have to see that struggle. I have so many sad memories with my daughter because my life was so chaotic in my early 20s (before I met my husband).

There were times I felt like I was rocking it, but other times I still felt just as confused and hopeless as before. My first was/is very *particular* about everything. My second was/is *clingy AF.* The catch with the second one too is that when you have the first, the world revolves around them. When you have the second, the world still revolves around the first. Now the first is wanting to go to the zoo, to gymnastics, to the park. The first already has a routine. The second just has to be along for the ride in situations you would have never put your first baby. First baby got a nap on his schedule in the crib with blackout curtains and a noise machine. Second baby *maybe* gets a nap if they can manage to fall asleep in the baby carrier at the zoo in the sound of screams and crashes and bangs. You are far from the finish line on this process. Don't beat yourself up if you realize you actually are just as lost the second time.",

      "As a father who only had 2 weeks to help my wife after giving birth, make sure to have patience. The transition from 2 parents helping to just one all day can be rough on your wife. Just have patience with her and try to understand if she feels more tired and a bit overwhelmed at first. I would recommend to do as much as possible before going to work so she can just focus on the baby. Like me, I sweep a bit, take out garbage, take out or prepare food for her to cook a meal. Clean bottles, fold any laundry, heat the water cuz we are solely formula feed and just picking up and making sure things are stocked. Try to help your wife be comfortable all day and not overwhelmed with house work and taking care of the baby. If you got time, send encouraging messages to your wife, let her know she's doing great and thank her for taking care of the baby while you're away. Let her know you love her and appreciate her. The little things matter, but you will miss your baby. I do now and she's 3 months old. I am lucky to come home for lunch and visit them both and try to help wash dishes from lunch or maybe hold the baby a bit to help her get a break. I think, once I know she has a peace of mind, I have a peace of mind, and it makes both of us happier."

Other places\u2019 lists started in April 2026, when my kid would already be 1 year old!",
      "I work in a daycare and this is 1000000% accurate. We currently quote expecting parents for when their child turns 3. I always feel bad when people are like 35 weeks pregnant and saying they are thinking ahead and looking into daycares. I want to be like \u201cGirl, I\u2019m sorry but you\u2019re like 9 months too late.\u201d",
      "I think this is highly dependent on where you live. I had heard similar and started calling daycares while I was pregnant. I was told by every one that I called that it was too soon to get on their waitlist and to call back after the baby was born. Each one had a waitlist of maybe 2-3 months tops."

      "I\u2019m currently 26 weeks pregnant. We called daycares at 5 weeks pregnant, just days after my positive test - earliest crib waitlist we could get was spring 2026. One place quoted me for summer 2026. We are in Indianapolis. We put the crib deposit down at 6 weeks pregnant (they only had two cribs left for spring 2026 and we NEEDED it) . Didn\u2019t have my first OB/ultrasound appointment until 2 weeks later! I asked the ultrasound tech if she was sure she saw only one - would have added to the waitlist time if there were two! Edit: funny tidbit: when we toured our daycare I was so sick with morning sickness, one of my main aversions was the smell of pasta cooking. They had the heat cranked up in the place\u2026 and it was spaghetti day for the kids! Tour started at 10am and they were prepping lunch in the hour we toured the building. Hell."

      "I am so, so sorry this happened to you. I had my own PPD as a mom and I can't *imagine* if my husband had been also struggling in the way it seemed like your partner was. Honestly, I think I'd have felt incredibly resentful and scared in your shoes, which is not to say that your partner doesn't have a right to have had his own depression -- just that it's hard for you both, and as a birthing parent, typically you're the one doing a lot of the healing/hormonal rollercoaster. You are 100% not the asshole, and this is 100% not your fault. I'm so glad to hear that things are better now that baby is a little older. But it also makes sense that the 180-degree shift is bizarre and that you're still struggling with how the last many months have been. It damaged your relationship, fractured trust, and left you in survival mode for a LONG time. I haven't experienced what you have, but if I were in your shoes, I think I'd be looking at some couple's counseling. Would your partner be open to that? Now that you both have the benefit of (a little bit of) hindsight, maybe it would be a good opportunity to reflect on what you were each experiencing and how it affected the other. My (first) baby is only 6 months old so I know I still have hindsight to gain myself, but I'm sure will be hard times to come as a parent even though we're out of the newborn stage. It might give you some peace of mind to work through what happened so that when the next hard time comes, you have tools in your emotional toolbox that you can deploy from therapy."

Honestly if I got a text that said \u201cI\u2019d rather be dead than watching the baby\u201d from the person who was alone with my child, I would take that as a sign that that person isn\u2019t safe around my kid.

Show him how to reach with his arm on top, so that his body ends up angled towards the floor. The hardest part for them is usually lifting their head so they can make the turn, you can support that by putting gentle counter-pressure on his hip+upper thigh and hopefully his head will pop up, if it doesn't then you help pick his head up off the floor. Practice with him every wake window, even if you do just one turn on each side and help him flip from tummy to back as well. At this point it's probably just a strength thing, they need to struggle enough to get the strength to do it on their own.",

It's already great that he can sit with assistance",

Support him at his hip, bring one leg across his body, and slooowly roll him onto his belly. - Roll him onto his tummy after every diaper change. - While he is lying on his back, hold a favorite toy in front of him at face level. As he reaches for it, slowly move it to the side to encourage him to roll that way. Unsupported sitting you can try: - Work your way towards supporting at the hips rather than underneath the arms. - Use toys that encourage him to sit up in order to play with them (our fav was a VTech busy cube, fisher price piano).",

Newborns are so finicky about everything and there could easily be a colic issue. Mine is now 6 months but at 3 weeks she was also very fussy and I was definitely crying every day. I don't want to say \"it's normal, don't worry, you'll be fine,\" but I do want to say that I had a similar experience and everything did eventually get better. I do think there's a fair amount of PURPLE crying up until 3-4 months (do look into it if your doc hasn't mentioned it already) which is basically just...unexplained crying. It's not super helpful in that that's not...diagnosable? Fixable? But it is helpful in that it's validating that it's not something you're doing wrong. All you can do is love on, snuggle, feed, and try to give him time to rest. But obviously you can't *make* him rest. Things will even out, I promise!"

      "Aside from \u201cbig\u201d things like DV/cheating/etc\u2026 I would say it is true. Resentment can be worked through, and I think when dealing with a new baby and total adjustment of life, it\u2019s good to give it a little time before burning it all down. That said, things won\u2019t magically fix themselves at a 1 year mark and will require a little effort to resolve. Additionally, if you\u2019re feeling resentment because you feel like you\u2019re the one handling all baby/home/work/life stuff\u2026 a couple things to note: 1. I initially micromanaged the crap out of my husband with the baby. He literally had to point out that I wasn\u2019t giving him the opportunity to learn to parent. It really didn\u2019t even occur to me until he said something. It would be discouraging and annoying at minimum to have one parent constantly barking at you to do something a certain way. So I backed off- unless I felt something was actually unsafe\u2026 which it never was- and just let him figure it out. Maybe he got peed on. Maybe the diaper wasn\u2019t perfect. Maybe the burp took a little time. I let him figure it out, and he grew sooo much as a parent and spouse when I just\u2026 backed off. And it took so much pressure off me that I put on myself. 2. I\u2019ll probably mess up the exact phrase but a quote both my husband and I make a point to (mostly) remember is - \u201cremember you\u2019re going to feel like you\u2019re giving 110% and your partner is only giving 60%\u2026 and they feel the exact same way about you.\u201d It helped me remember that we are both actually really trying and that it may not look the same, but he\u2019s putting in work too. 3. I started to intentionally focus on things he does do for us. With resentment, it\u2019s so easy to snowball. You start to notice every little thing that annoys you and every little shortcoming. I tried to balance that with positives. Actually what I found was that my husband does a lot, and I just was focused on specific things I needed help with, instead of looking at the whole unit. 4. We talked. A lot. I didn\u2019t express \u201cyou don\u2019t do xyz\u201d but rather \u201cI need help with xyz.\u201d Sometimes that means sourcing out work. Sometimes that meant he helped me simplify. Sometimes that meant he took over more responsibility. The outcome wasn\u2019t always just that husband picks up \u201cslack.\u201d We were able to brainstorm and tackle the things I was struggling with as a team. 5. What fills your cup? We discussed this also- and we prioritized. He needs to workout. It\u2019s his thing. I need less workout but I still need some for me to feel good. We have locked times into our schedule for this. It has to be something like illness that changes this. But everything else- laundry/dishes/dinner- it all will wait. Having your priorities and then working life around those can be really refreshing. When my LO was younger, I used to just take a 20-40 minute walk by myself at the end of the day to just disconnect. Whatever it is, talk about it. And this changes over time, at least for us it has, so we revisit. 6. I went on a weekend vacation. My baby was older at this point (maybe around 13-14 months) and I took a little girls trip. It was great but also it gave my husband a peek at what I do on the day to day. He\u2019s also gone on boy trips since and it gives me a peek at how much he actually does help. 7. Be careful with the hen house. Negativity is contagious, and I\u2019m always careful about complaining to friends too much about marital issues. Obviously we all need to vent, but tread lightly. Sometimes these feelings and negative emotions can make us also see things negatively. If all of your friends are resentful and angry at their husbands\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 just seems like a stretch to say there\u2019s not one good dad/spouse in the mix. Maybe the focus is off. 8. Have sex! Have fun! Schedule a date night every month! Connect!! Remember why you fell in love and started a family. Relationships are so tough sometimes. I do think that first and even second year of children is incredibly taxing. Even though we walked through some similar emotions, I\u2019m soooo glad I didn\u2019t throw it all away. Just my two cents though. Good luck!",
      "The first 6 months after our first was born, I was in the throes of PPD and PPA. We were both sleep deprived and exhausted, and both working while taking care of the baby. And during those first few months, I absolutely despised my husband. I googled divorce lawyers so many times. I wanted to run away and never go back. Then I got help for my PPA and PPD. The resentment got better. I allowed myself to trust him and his way of parenting, even if it wasn\u2019t a carbon copy of my parenting (something that I used to be angry at him for - Especially with PPA). By 9 months PP, we were laughing together again. By 12 months PP, I was absolutely head over heels for my husband again. Our second baby was born 4 months ago and this time around there was no resentment, no anger, no jealousy. It was so easy to love my husband and parent together. I am definitely team \u201cdon\u2019t say divorce\u201d unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary (like DV).",
      "I mean, I didn\u2019t want to divorce him, but from 2ish months to 7ish months I\u2019ve never resented anyone more. I would be up a million times a night nursing the baby back to sleep and he\u2019d be snoring. It\u2019s the most bitter I\u2019ve ever been, that\u2019s for sure. It got better once we moved baby to his own room and my husband started taking lead at bedtime. We\u2019re 13 months out now and things are great! No more resentment and we feel like a strong team and family unit. The pets on the other hand\u2026.",
      "Yes, 100% wait. There is absolutely no better head start you can give a child than being raised in a house with two biological parents. That's not to say a child who doesn't live with both their biological parents won't be ok, but it's definitely advantageous for the child if you can manage it. My mother was a single mom before she met my father. My grandmother was a single mom and the most successful and financially stable person in our family. I'm not hating on single moms. It's hard though, both on the mother and the children.",
      "I don\u2019t ever think you should have to stay in a bad relationship. I think 2 things. 1. This timeline is deeply imbedded in misogyny. If women put up with their partner not doing their part for a year I think the women figure it out by that time. The baby gets easier, and it gets easier to do it all. So you start letting go that your husband is not your partner. 2. I think it can be helpful if your issues are coming from ppd or sleep deprivation to work through that prior to making your decision. Each situation is different, and no I would never put a blanket rule on anything. If you were left to heal and take care of the baby on your own, if you were pressured into sex, if you are expected to carry the load of the whole home pp then I think these are all reasonable reasons to get divorced that would only come to fruition within the first year. I fell deeper in love with my husband after our child was born. The way he cared for me, the way he cared for our daughter it all just made me love him more. I wish this for all of you. We deserve this. Real partners who step up when we need them."

      "Yes it's true. Me and my husband go together so well and have been together for over 10 years, but when our baby was born we were always in arguments. It's a high stress situation and stress causes fights. We felt so alone and depressed and resented each other, I would wonder how I ended up with such a jerk but it was literally the stress. Now 5 months in things are better because there's less stress but still we have no intimacy because of the hormones still since I'm breastfeeding. You need time to get back to normal",
      "Resentment builds because its changed EVERYTHING for mum, and not much for dad. Its really difficult to not hold resentment. We have our second baby and I know its not my.husbands fault, but I hold resentment and im consciously trying to stop it. Im jealous he can just go for a shower or go upstairs for 30 mins for a smoke. What about meeeeee. I dont get a quiet poo let alone anything more. But that really is just how it is. Our second is very clingy to me, wants to feed often and screams with my husband. Its very early days (8 weeks), it WILL get better. Once she isnt breastfeeding, it'll be a different ball game. But for now its just how it is but its accepting that thats hard because you do ache for some peace. I remind myself its us against them (not lierally lol) not me and against my husband. We've had some of our worst arguments this time round, and its defo fuled by hormones exhaustion, stress. But defo dont make a judgement now. Talk things through, work together.",
      "I left 2 years after and I regretted it. We needed counseling, not divorce. We were stressed and tired being both working parents, and mix that in with lack of communication and we grew resentment. There was no abuse. I went into a deep depression about it afterwards too. Please try counseling first. Not everyone is happier after divorce.",
      "It is true that the first year of having a child really strains the relationship. Both of you are exhausted, sleepless, frustrated and at the end of your patience. All your effort and patience and calm and energy goes to the baby, leaving none for eachother. So small things feel bigger. That's why it might be a good idea to hang in there till the baby gets a bit easier, and reevaluate after you both get some sleep, eat something, have a moment to breathe... That starts to happen about a year after having the baby. That said, if only one of you is exhausted and sleepless while the other is getting at least 6 hours of sleep every night, if only one if you has to wait for a golden opportunity just so they can have a 5min shower, while the other one spends 45 mins on the toilet, if only one of you is going out with friends while the other is stuck at home alone with the baby.... Then that relationship is dead already. No point in trying to get to the 1 year mark, its not gonna get better. Because clearly one partner is selfish and lazy and immature while the other partner is crushed alone under the weight and responsibility of having a family.",
      "Most of our disagreements were petty because we were exhausted, hungry, and in need of a shower. Those were mainly disagreements about chores/responsibilities. Eventually, the phrase, *remember, the REAL enemy is the baby* helped us out because it\u2019s a joke and a reminder that we\u2019re on the same team. There was a period of lack of sex that impacted our marriage as well. We\u2019re still figuring that thing out."

      "Ped nurse: might take two people for this depending on your kids\u2019 size and your own dexterity lol. This is the way I strong arm medicine into a kid. Have the medicine ready to go in arms reach. Hold the child like you\u2019re rocking a baby in a cradle hold, so they\u2019re on their back. This helps gravity get it to the back of their throat. You or someone else put syringe in mouth. Before starting to push the medicine, squeeze their lips like a fish. Do NOT let go of their cheeks. This is critical. Keeps them from being able to spit it out. You can give them breaks between swallows, but do not let go of those cheeks. Once you let go, they will spit it out and their cheeks will be slippery from medicine/tears/spit and you won\u2019t be able to get the hold back. If they start to cough, give them a break but don\u2019t let go of cheeks. If they start to gag, also give a break. If they throw up, try again later. Most important for this is that they won\u2019t hate you, and comfort them after. You have to do this for their own good, you are taking care of them and they need that to feel safe and loved. Don\u2019t feel bad about doing what\u2019s best for them. If all else fails, Tylenol rectal suppositories are available over the counter. And Frida makes a pacifier that a syringe can attach to, if your babe sucks on pacis that helps a ton! Sometimes helps to keep on top of meds too if they have a fever and feel crummy, they\u2019re more likely to be as cooperative (as developmentally possible) if they feel slightly better.",

      "How old? Does he take a bottle at all? You can put it in with a small bottle (think an ounce or so); mix it well and let him drink that. You can give a tiny bit at a time and wipe it with your finger when he spits and put it right back in his mouth. We found the most success once he had been introduced to solids and was used to the idea that spoons would have weird and new flavors on them. I took a baby spoon, squirted a tiny bit of medicine from the dropper in it and let him eat it off the spoon. Did that over and over until my dropper was empty. Bonus is that I could use the spoon to wipe up any spillage and re-serve it.",

Now at 9 months I let her taste it then she sucks on the syringe as I slowly depress it. When they had tongue thrust reflex I put a little in and kept pushing it back into their mouth with the syringe to get them to swallow as much as possible. Same way they did the rotavirus vaccine.",
      "Oof been there. When he was really little, I\u2019d put it in a bottle nipple and he would suck it out before he really knew what had happened. I\u2019ve also put it in frozen teethers that had berries in it to mask the taste. But if you really get desperate, depending on the age, you can do suppositories.",
      "Suppositories for pain killers. For antibiotics, force free through syringe (because mine never took pacis or bottles so mixing it into milk wasn't an option). As soon as they are old enough, switch to chewables and market it as 'medicine candy'.",
      "Tip their head back slightly. And then I push her jaw closed, so she has to swallow, but also try to get in the back of their mouth. My little one is used to the syringe now, that when I need to give her something, when she's teething badly, she'll open up her mouth. But sometimes I still need to close her mouth or it'll dribble out.",

Told big sis I was getting baby to sleep and I would be with her as soon as possible. She got a snack, put on her tonies, and \u201cread\u201d a book. By herself!!! I was shocked. I would get babe down, pop to sister, then when babe had a false start, I went back to babe. Big sis stayed in her room and quietly entertained herself. I was shocked!!! Big sis is never independent.

Most of the time I bathe them together. I pull the baby out first and get him ready for bed and feed him next to the tub while the 3 year old plays in the water.

I\u2019m 31 and he\u2019s 23. Would I have preferred to have grown up with him more as my peer? Sure. I actually wanted a sibling all while I grew up. But, I am very grateful that I do have a sibling! And the gap will keep closing. One day I\u2019ll be 46 and he\u2019ll be 38 and that doesn\u2019t sound like that much of a gap. I would say, be realistic on how your daughter will bond with the new baby, because they probably won\u2019t be friends growing up like children who are closer than age are. But, they\u2019ll still be siblings and all that! It will be a different relationship and if they\u2019re like me it will probably take longer to cultivate but that\u2019s OK.

      "We did a lot of dividing and conquering for the first six or so months. My husband would help with the baby in the night when she needed settling, but she was exclusively breastfed so I was up with her much more frequently. In return, he did the vast majority of care for our older kiddo for that first six months or so (morning routine, bedtime routine, playing and care on the weekends, etc). And yes, he would always let me sleep in if at all possible, since I was up much more in the night. In my experience, if the mom is the default parent for the child (as tends to be the usual), having a second child is way more of a life change for your spouse than it is for you! Even if you have a really great and involved coparent. The transition from being not the default parent, to being the default parent for somebody by necessity, is pretty significant. I definitely would start getting both your husband and your child used to this change now!! He needs to realize that his relaxed childfree morning routines are over. And they both need to get used to it before there\u2019s a newborn and sleep deprivation and postpartum hormones making everything much harder.",

I felt like it was a lot to ask him to get everyone ready plus himself, when I had the ability to help and could go back to sleep. This worked for us! By the time I went back to work, baby was sleeping better so we both just tag team getting everyone ready for work/daycare/school.",

So I pump, husband feeds baby around 6am and currently she's up so we all go downstairs and start breakfast. If toddler is up whoever is done with breakfast gets toddler up and we just tag team everything. It's fun with the new baby because her schedule changes all the time, she used to go back to sleep after the morning feed but recently not so much. Toddler used to sleep until 7/730 and is now waking up at like 630. We just adjust. When baby was a super newborn and husband was on mat leave, I got every nap I wanted. He usually wrangled toddler while I had baby all day bc we were working on breastfeeding/latch. When he went back to work he did what he could before leaving but even at a couple weeks old our baby was sleeping a pretty good 6 hour stretch at night and then we'd all go back to bed for another couple hours so we haven't been tooooo delirious with baby #2.

If we have a really good night I wake up and get my daughter dressed for daycare to spend some extra time with her. I go back to work in 3 weeks and I think he\u2019ll still be on primary toddler duty to get her ready and I feed & her baby ready, but I\u2019ll do drop off (he\u2019s been doing it while I\u2019m on leave). Once baby\u2019s sleep is more routine I\u2019ll try to own the whole morning, so he can get out of the door a little earlier (he\u2019d like to leave at 6:30, but right now it\u2019s 6:50 since we can\u2019t drop off at daycare until 7 and my daughter wakes closer to 6:30). For now it is really fluid with non concrete timelines since every baby is different. But hoping baby\u2019s sleep overnight is more predictable in the next couple months.

We all eat together and then Dad and toddler are off to daycare drop off (my husband works remotely so he comes back home). In the newborn and early post partum days, we had no choice but to have a divide and conquer approach. One child, one parent with small switches here and there for bonding. Most mornings, I couldn't even function and in those early feed every 2-3 hours around the clock days, my husband actually slept in my toddler's room so he was rested (sleep deprived driving is just as bad as driving drunk). He would wake up early to take care of his own needs (which also meant he went to bed with the toddler at 9pm and I was solo through the night), then wake and feed/get toddler ready and do drop off. If I could muster it, I would wake up and give my toddler a hug but some days I couldn't and he would sneak into my room/bed for morning snuggles. The mom guilt was so bad during those first couple of months. We also spoke to the daycare and let them know there wouldn't be any consistency for a while with drop off and pick-ups.

      "I 100% feel this. My family is abusive so I live 1500+ miles from them. All of my \u201cfriends\u201d ghosted me after I gave birth (we own bars so I couldn\u2019t get them any free drinks anymore while home recovering and was therefore unimportant, I guess\u2026 no one ever checked in on me so I could find out and I\u2019m not going begging for attention if they can\u2019t be bothered or weren\u2019t really my friends to begin with.). I live out in the country, while my husband works long hours, so I was ALONE 10-12+ hours a day with the baby with absolutely no one to talk to (he was facing some ppd, too, so came home exhausted, drank too much and was zero help. He got it turned around eventually.). I couldn\u2019t even leave the house for months at a time. I actually resorted to texting with my abusive mother out of desperation. I was injured during childbirth, so had that to contend with PLUS I\u2019m an older mother (in my 40s) and the massive postpartum hormonal shift pushed me into perimenopause(which is SO fucked up, no one ever talks about how bad it is). They were rough days. It took me 2.5 years to pull out of that funk.",
      "How long ago did you give birth? I ask because the first 2 weeks after birth, you can get the \u201cbaby blues\u201d which is the sugarcoated way of saying you\u2019ll likely cry constantly, may feel like you made a mistake, may experience su!cidal thoughts, and will likely overall feel like you\u2019ve been thrown in a ditch and left for dead. I thought for sure I had ppd, but my therapist told me many times to be kind to myself, that I was experiencing a MASSIVE hormonal shift, and that I would be okay. No one talks about how bad the \u201cbaby blues\u201d is, and the name is so pathetic compared to how terrible we feel!",

I sat around and ate chocolate. Girl, I was fine most of the time.",

      "LO is 4mo. I had a traumatic pregnancy (HG for 7 months) but not traumatic birth. I\u2019m tired, but my baby is a pretty good sleeper and has a generally chill temperament. We love taking him places and he loves meeting new people. My husband and I have our hard days because we are adjusting to our new lives, but we are doing well. We allow the other person to go out with friends and have a life as much as possible. Much of the time we are overjoyed to be raising such a wonderful little fella. He makes us soooooo happy. A love we never imagined was possible. I\u2019ve been working out like a beast for the last 3 months which I think has really helped my mental health. I was very physically active before pregnancy and not being able to workout for 9 months because of the HG was unbearable. My husband understands this, and watches our LO from 6:30 to 8p, 6 days a week so I can workout.",
      "Right up to the four month mark was pretty rough for me. I definitely had some PPD that I wasn\u2019t dealing with, also didn\u2019t help that my baby was born in November so my very generous 6 months of mat leave were just the grossest, darkest months of the year. My husband went back to work after 12 weeks and though I\u2019m very lucky that my parents live in our in-law and came to help often, I still felt very isolated when it was just me and my baby. Top it off with the fact that he needed contact naps 75% of the time so I wasn\u2019t getting any time to myself. Right after the four month mark, I kind of felt the fog start to lift (I made a post that\u2019s in my post history if you\u2019re interested in reading it). I\u2019m 7 months pp now and I feel like the fog lifting was a combo of slightly nicer weather, a realization that I wouldn\u2019t get this time of just me and baby back again, and kind of getting my sea legs of parenthood under me. Since then, things have gotten progressively easier. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s easy in general by any means - I still find being a parent very, very hard and at this point I am considering being one and done despite originally wanting 3 kids. But pretty much everything I once worried about, I don\u2019t need to anymore (he sleeps much more consistently, mostly naps in his crib, and he\u2019s become a much happier baby in general now that he has the ability to move around). Those have been replace with new worries of course, but I think I now have the perspective that it\u2019s all so temporary and things will resolve themselves. I did also feel better once I went back to work. I\u2019m not incredibly passionate about my job, and it\u2019s demanding and difficult to fit everything I need to into a day, but it is time that I get to interact with adults, use my brain, and honestly just pee or grab coffee whenever I want, and having that separation where I don\u2019t need to be \u201con\u201d as a mom has helped me. I obviously miss my son during the day and understand the downsides of having to work as a mom, but I think I\u2019m a happier parent with this outlet. Plus, my son is with my parents and in-laws and he loves them and has so much fun. It does get better, but the timeline is different for everyone. And there is no shame in getting help if you feel like you need it! I kind of wish I did.",
      "Yea I was over the moon the first few months and now with my husband back at work I feel like I entered into the very hard part of being with my baby 24/7, being madly in love with him, and needing time to myself but having no idea how to ask for help and feeling insanely overwhelmed despite this being such a wonderful time in the grand scheme of things. I\u2019ve also noticed my husband is less engaged and almost less competent while my competence seems to be increasing all day everyday. Little One is easy overall so that\u2019s good, I do find I have something to be anxious about everyday like my brain needs something silly to fixate on.",
      "I\u2019m 4 months pp. Baby still wakes every 2 ish hours. Sometimes he will go for longer stretches but never more than 3+ hours. I think my hormones are still out of whack because I\u2019m still gagging and nauseous on a daily basis lol just lovely. I do feel like postpartum has made me more anxious in general\u2026.not even just about baby stuff. Just everything. At this point I am chronically tired and so is my husband lol he works long hours so I care for baby for about 18-19 hours and then my husband takes night shift. We definitely feel like room mates but thankfully we still do one date a week while baby is with grandma. Also, I had a traumatic pregnancy and labor -ended up in a c section. Baby was also incredibly fussy to the point where I rushed to the ER at one point lol the first 2 months were terrible. I had PPD until week 9. I love him now though I am obsessed with my boy!!!",
      "My baby just turned 3 months and things are slightly improving. The baby is happy and smart. I feel quite alone: \u200b\u200bI expected more visits from friends, but people were satisfied with updates via messages and only one friend came to my house (apart from the family, of course). Even my therapist said she would visit me and she never actually came. Zoloft from early pregnancy. And so this is the loneliness of motherhood that people talk about so much. My biggest challenge is my disconnection with my husband. He helps a little, but I resent him for getting on with his hobbies and going out while I'm here 24/7 and don't even have time to wash my hair. He shows love and interest in intimacy, but I feel distant. Problems prior to pregnancy and unresolved. I thought the baby's arrival would change that."

The physical recovery was not something I was not prepared for. I was induced at 42 weeks (HELL! I\u2019m still processing the mindfuck of the last 2 weeks) with a vaginal birth with suction. But as someone who depends on exercise and activity for mental health (my lifeline during a fairly easy pregnancy), it has been so so tough to be so limited still at 12 weeks pp due to bad Pubic symphesis pain and pelvic floor damage.

I\u2019ve never given into therapy but this is so bad and scary that I can\u2019t not talk to a professional about it.

I cant take criticism, I react fiercely with emotions and need reassurance almost constantly. Yes my husband did try and help, but its been 10 years, hes kinda losing his will to keep it up because he sees no changes. I used to think shit be doesn't care anymore but its not that, he just doesn't know what to do because what he did do, hasn't worked. I tell him it helps but he rightfully says no, because nothing changes. I seek help elsewhere, so ive reached out to a perinatal mental health team. I recommend you do the same. It gives you a non judgemental space to get it out and process it. Hes probably processing it too, and maybe hes further along and struggles to keep talking about it because it brings it back for him? Its not nice but it doesn't mean he doesn't care, hes human"

Obviously a change which is rough on a toddler, he cries when the baby cries, he gets jealous - but the jealousy has made him more cuddly which has been nice.

      "You are absolutely not in the wrong here and you're doing an amazing job. BLW at 6 months is a totally valid and widely accepted approach. So many pediatricians are still stuck in old-school thinking, but that doesn\u2019t mean you're wrong. You're clearly watching your baby, making informed decisions, and she's thriving that's what matters. The way she spoke to you? Not okay. It\u2019s not just what she said, it\u2019s how she said it. Pediatricians should educate, not shame. And as a first-time mom, you deserve support, not snark. Also, the vitamin D thing? Lots of moms don\u2019t get told that! You're not alone. That should\u2019ve been explained gently at the beginning, not thrown at you like a quiz you failed. You trusted them with your baby\u2019s care and were treated like a nuisance. That\u2019s a valid reason to feel shaken and frustrated. I\u2019m really glad to hear you\u2019re switching providers you and your baby deserve someone who empowers you, not tears you down. You're not crazy. You're not a bad mom. You\u2019re doing your best and from the sounds of it, you\u2019re doing damn well. \u2764",
      "We did BLW starting at 4 months (she was born at 41w+2, and has been above 90% length above 65% weight every checkup, she was sitting independently and interested in foods) after pediatrician gave the \u201cgo ahead\u201d to start solids at her 4 mo appointment but encouraged fortified baby cereal and pur\u00e9es and discouraged BLW. We tried the cereal like twice but she didn\u2019t like it so we just did BLW anyway, (and omg there\u2019s like seriously nothing cuter than a toothless 5 mo old enthusiastically gumming it up on a whole floret of steamed broccoli or a chicken drumstick). I think she got some pur\u00e9es at daycare (which she started at 6 mo) but never at home. By 7 months she\u2019d had all the allergens and most common foods and we started just giving her whatever we were eating just cut up so it wasn\u2019t a choking risk. We didn\u2019t even worry about salt, since we don\u2019t overseason things and cook most things ourselves with very little processed. When they started testing iron they were shocked at the pediatrician how good her iron count was (in spite of no fortified cereal) We recently switched daycares and they can\u2019t stop going on about what a good eater she is. At 17 months she can feed herself basically everything. She loves gnawing on whole apples (btw, something to keep in mind, seems very helpful for when canines start coming in, which hoo boy, seem worse than the molars were). She can use a spoon or fork reasonably competently. She takes bites off of larger things like bananas. She tries everything and likes most everything. We never had to play the \u201copen the hanger, here comes the airplane!\u201d game, we all just ate together and all enjoyed our own meals. She\u2019s a less picky eater than her 5-8yr old cousins. I\u2019m so glad we didn\u2019t listen to the pediatrician, you\u2019re doing everything right and your baby will be so happy to be eating good food with you and not stressed about mashing spoonfuls of gross unseasoned pur\u00e9es into their unwilling mouth. You\u2019re doing great.",

She also needs to do scar maintenance and this is massaging the tissue and also possibly using dialators for a couple weeks to see any difference etc. again the urologist will be able to better set a treatment plan for her especially if she might need to be surgically revised if she's over tight where even therapy does not work etc. Or prescribed estrogen especially if breastfeeding etc. Meanwhile while y'all wait for that appointment etc you can start some basic scar and tissue rejuvenation at home You can do this with silicone lube* since it's good for scars, Kinda like masterbation...so a partner can help but realize its not about sex or you etc. The endgoal is to have better health to her genitals long term not short term. *i recommend alternating lube and vaginal moisturizers and oils like fractionated coconut oil. Obviously if using sexual health aid devices and toys be aware of compatibility etc.",
      "I didn\u2019t have a traumatic birth but I did tear. Almost 11 months postpartum and it\u2019s still painful. My surgeon said it can take up to 18 months to fully heal. It\u2019s worth getting an appointment to see if there\u2019s anything complicating the healing. I did Winback (Tecar therapy) on my scar, that was amazing and really helped. She can try massaging the scar with almond oil, and try to increase the pressure every few days. Pelvic floor PT is a must, the exercises and massages will really help. And just give herself some grace, her body went through something really hard, it\u2019s going to take some time to feel better.",
      "I had a third-degree tear and can relate to painful sex. Pelvic floor PT helped a lot to strengthen the muscles again (muscle fatigue and atrophy can cause pain). I also had granulation tissue removed from my scar site, which was probably the thing that helped the most with the pain. Granulation tissue is like a keloid scar that forms on mucosal tissue, like inside the vagina. This was a pretty painless procedure--the doctor (urogynecologist) just used silver nitrate to dissolve and remove it. That might be a helpful procedure to look into. Lots of vibrator use, stretching with fingers before sex, etc. -- I'm 10 months PP and it's starting to get better, but the only thing that helps is consistently using those muscles! I'm sorry this is something you and your wife are experiencing. It's a really hard dynamic to introduce to your relationship on top of a new baby.",

She may not remember or it may all be worth it but it's still INCREDIBLY traumatic on the body. Also if she is breastfeeding or pumping that will cause her hormones to be all messed up and this will cause additional lubrication issues until her supply dries up.",
      "It is a realistic possible issue after a traumatic birth. I am 24m postpartum and still have nerve issues that makes intercourse painful. I\u2019ve been seeing pelvic floor physio and a gynaecologist who specializes in traumatic birth recovery. I would encourage your wife to see both. Estrogen cream and lidocaine cream can help but she may also need injections or oral nerve blocking medication.",
      "Is she breastfeeding? Hormones from bf can make sex very painful for a long time even without the scar/episiotomy issues. I had two c-sections and still it was very painful for the first 9-12 months. I agree with seeing a doc and a pelvic PT too!",
      "Oestrogen cream really helps. I had a grade 2 tear and an episiotomy scar that felt gross for ages. The doc prescribed oestrogen cream and that shit is magic. Does she get keloid scars anywhere else? It\u2019s going to need a trip to the gynaecologist I\u2019m afraid.",
      "I was put on Estridol cream when I had issues after my first. I had a second degree tear and had so much pain. Used it for a few weeks and it helped so much."

      "Hey, sending hugs. I conceived my first after 3 cycles no problem, was shocked that it took a year for #2 (which I know is not technically infertility but seems similar to where OP is at). It\u2019s so hard to have your hopes raised and smashed every month for that long. I\u2019m sorry you are going through it. My husband and I were the same ages as you while TTC. My AMH sucked for a 35 year old but I was still ovulating regularly (trust me I became neurotic about my tracking methods). I ended up conceiving on cycle 11 or 12, immediately after an HSG (which showed no blockage). I have heard that can be common, maybe flushing something out, idk. I know it sucks so bad but I think in the end your chances are still pretty good. I wish I had better advice for coping but I didn\u2019t do well with it.

Read the f*cking manual. Also... Pick a baby book and read it and try to follow it. And when things are going sideways, go back to the book. I read both 12 hours by 12 weeks and Mom's on Call. I also like the book Crib Sheet, but it's not really a How To book. Oh, and if your insurance covers a lactation consultant, get a lactation consultant from time to time. My wife had a pretty easy time breast feeding. We still saw a lactation consultant 5 times. Don't crap as you need it, you won't need at least half the stuff you buy. What was the question again?

Naturally, she developed a fear around doctors and medical stuff that progressed into an anxiety disorder. She's doing great now that we have a child psychiatrist on her care team. She is still scared to go to the doctor but we have all learned ways to help her manage her anxiety. I wouldn't be surprised if your child will develop some medical anxiety, and with everything going on, I can understand not even realizing that can become and issue until it does, like it did for us. But if you are able to jump on iot now, you could prevent a lot of anxiety not just on your child's part, but yours too. It's going to be hard, but you can make happy memories here too. It's okay to have joyful moments, don't feel guilty about them. Sometimes it can feel wrong to laugh and joke in such a serious time, but it's really okay. Take care of yourself. You are going to be all consumed with your child. It's only natural. Do not feel like you have to completely put yourself on the back burner. You are an important ky to your child getting healthy. You need to be healthy too. When my daughter went down for naps or to sleep for the night, I made that \"adult time\" which usually consisted of watching Harry Potter or Downton Abbey, just something that wasn't another Disney movie. Sounds a little strange maybe, but I enjoyed having something on that had a darker tone, because you really can only watch (insert child's movie obsession of choice) so many times. There are often many nearby restaurants that will deliver to hospitals, so you aren't stuck with hospital food. This is also probably a good time to take up a new, very portable hobby. Even if it's just coloring books for adults, that's good enough. I'm just picking up embroidery, which will be nice if we ever have to stay in the hospital again.

The biggest advice I have is to advocate for your child. Trust your doctors, but ask ALL the questions and get involved in your child's care. Doctors don't know your kiddo like you do. Don't be afraid to speak up and ask for other opinions if you're unsure. And give yourself grace. Screen time is okay. Popsicles for breakfast are okay. You do what you have to do to make this time as easy as possible for your child. Judgment free. I saw others recommend Child Life services -- totally agree. You'll get through this.",

Mine learned to just accept any syringe I shoved in her mouth and we rarely had any fights over medicine. Does he have a port? Or central line? If it\u2019s a central line, I found the easiest way to do dressing changes was by putting her favorite program on her tablet and then she would focus on that while I did the dressing changes. Products like SensiCare Adhesive Remover Spray are a GODSEND. Buy a couple cans. When we were going through chemo, my daughter went from eating anything and everything I would offer her to eating almost nothing. There was a period of time when she would only drink milk mixed with Pediasure and those were her meals (and unfortunately, since that\u2019s not enough to sustain a small child, she ended up having to \u201ceat\u201c frequently, even during the night). Nights were rough\u2026 We ended up abandoning her crib training and keeping her in the bed with us. There were a number of nights where we woke up to her vomiting. There were multiple evenings where she started running a fever (as kids do) and the rule on chemo is fever=ER ASAP. The majority of those times, we got sent home when the labs were normal. One time we got admitted for a week because she had neutropenic fever and had to get high dose IV antibiotics and be monitored. I can\u2019t tell you on how many occasions I slept snuggled up with her in the crib they give the little kiddos at the hospital because she was scared and the nurses come in every few hours for vitals. Be prepared for random infections that you don\u2019t see in normal, healthy populations. My daughter was vaccinated when she turned one for chickenpox, but due to the immunocompromise from the chemo, she ended up developing disseminated shingles. A friend\u2019s daughter being treated for leukemia had Pseudomonas and had to be admitted to the hospital for severe infection from a mosquito bite. If he\u2019s on a medicine that will cause hair loss, it happens with a quickness. My daughter was on three different chemo medications and one was more notorious than the others for hair loss. She didn\u2019t start on that one until three weeks into her treatment. After a week, we started to notice a strand of hair or two coming out. By the end of the second week it was coming out in handfuls so we went ahead and shaved her head. Those bald little heads get very cold and can sunburn easily so hats are a must! This is an awful time to go through this because of Covid. My poor husband had to sit in the car well I was generally the one who went in for her treatments/procedures because only one parent could go in. I know some places have eased those rules a bit but our hospital just recently went back to only allowing one parent in. You will meet a child life specialist. Those people are amazing. They will provide your kiddo with toys while they do their chemo infusion and when my daughter finished with radiation and on occasion \u201cjust because\u201c, they provided her with gifts/toys/blankets. They also come around in the hospital if your kiddo is inpatient to provide toys. They even on one occasion brought us some Starbucks gift cards. Where are you located? We also had some dealings with the Roc Solid Foundation Who provided a swingset for my daughter. I believe they are only in North and South Carolina. We also dealt with Children\u2019s Cancer Partners of the Carolinas who helped to cover gas, parking garage expenses and meals on treatment/hospital days. I would assume that wherever you are they probably have a similar group that a social worker can introduce you to. Cancer is incredibly isolating. You worry constantly about your kid getting exposed to anything because of the chemotherapy and immunocompromise. It is so much worse with Covid. I constantly joke that I don\u2019t know if I would have rather it happen at a different time because covid itself has been very isolating for everyone\u2026 to have gone through a year or so of social distancing only to then add on another year of isolating because I didn\u2019t want to expose my kid to anything would have driven me off the deep end. People will try to console you and ask you if you need anything\u2026 You\u2019ll likely think to yourself you have no idea what you need or when you\u2019ll need it. They don\u2019t fully understand the depth of the isolation that you will go through. I encountered lots of frustration from family who wanted to visit and then would get angry if I said they needed to isolate for two weeks and get a Covid test before coming to visit. Covid may not affect kids as badly, but a kid with no immune system doesn\u2019t have a fighting chance. Even a head cold can be detrimental. Protect your child, use the resources that the oncologist provides to you and reach out to any other parents going through a similar situation (our oncologist constantly had fliers up about group meet ups for siblings or parents for support/open discussion) because they are some of the only people who will fully understand what you\u2019re going through. I can\u2019t really think of much else right now\u2026 If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. We went through 17 rounds of chemo, six rounds of radiation, and 5 surgeries before getting the all-clear in May. It was the longest 9 months of my life and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone. Just know that you are about to find a whole new depths of inner strength that you never knew you had \ud83d\udc9b\ud83c\udf97 PS September is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month",
      "So, my child does not have cancer, but we did spend some time in the hospital with her on a ventilator which, while likely shorter in duration, spawned some of the feelings I\u2019m guessing you will encounter. First of all, I am so sorry for the weight that you are bearing with this. I know that doesn\u2019t help, but that precious baby doesn\u2019t deserve this and you don\u2019t deserve to watch it. This is YOUR horror story, not his. They told us that in the emergency room the very first day. He\u2019s not going to remember this. Even though it will scar you for the rest of your life, it won\u2019t him. Cling to that. Get something to pass the time that isn\u2019t your phone. For me, it was sudoku, but anything to do to take your mind off things while he naps is good. Befriend his nurses. Write your questions down as you think of them so you can ask them all at once instead of piecemeal. Walk around the hospital if you can - I know our options were sort of limited with Covid, but getting your blood pumping helps. Fuck the rules. Let him nap on you if he wants, let him cry and fuss if he needs without trying to shush him, give him the snacks he grabs for, whatever. That shit just doesn\u2019t matter, which I know you know by now. Finally, look into therapy. I have developed some post-traumatic stress from our experience and it became very obvious early on that if I didn\u2019t address it with professional help, it was going to seriously impact my life and my children\u2019s lives in a negative. The anxiety about safety after a health event in your child\u2019s life can be very, very overwhelming on a good day - add in a global pandemic and, like, I guess just go fuck yourself because no one could possibly navigate this. I will be thinking about you and your sweet, sweet baby. This sucks, and it\u2019s ok to be mad or sad or whatever you want. We are so used to guarantees and certainties and when you can\u2019t get them about the health of your child\u2026 it\u2019s just breathtakingly painful. I feel your pain in my soul, friend, and I look forward to the day that you wake up and this is all a memory.",
      "Medical science has made MASSIVE advancements from 20 years ago. Its still okay for YOU to be scared and cry.",
      "What a precious little one! The sweetest eyes! I\u2019ll be praying for both of you as you begin this difficult journey. Allow yourself to cry and be sad whenever you need. I\u2019m so sorry you guys are dealing with this and we\u2019ll keep you in my prayers. \ud83e\udd0d"

      "A lot of comments about how OP should have had more empathy before being in the situation herself, but I think what she has admitted to has deep roots in social messaging we get about motherhood / the female gender, and that her \"judgements\" were really internalized fears about being seen as \"less* of an individual, less of a person; once a mom. There is a lot of complex pressure and sexism that we are all being fed, for example here in in the context of careers/ workplace and being the chill/cool/down-for-anything party girl. So much of this is still defined by an outdated male perspective....women only succeeding on the male scale of success. A lot of this also has to do with capitalism because it comes down to earning power, and if not the earner, then you've got to be the one that's nice to look at. Moms cast off these social rules to fiercely care for their babies and that should be seen as raw, powerful and successful, broadening a women's identity, not taking away from it. Motherhood, from thr messy bun to the early nights, is a symbol of strength and success, but it will take a while I fear for this to be understood by the collective western psyche. Edit; for typos. My 2 month old is contact napping and limiting my texting ability!",

I had been working so hard to be a more relaxed and gentle parent and even reached new goals during the pregnancy, but now this. It's like everytime I reach a new threshold of patience and grace with my older one, an increased element of difficulty is added to the situation making it harder to be patient.

A new mom is in a very vulnerable place just after birth and can't just leave the hospital where she needs the care she's receiving. These moms need better coordinated care and to have their need for sleep respected unless essential services need to be performed like vital checks. Why do we just accept subpar, but very expensive healthcare?",

When we finally got to the hospital (skipping his actual birth because it's a longish story) I was on a trolley being taken as slow as possible through the hospital, I was naked and had just a sad sorry bloodstained dressing gown on, so they all got a good look at my front completely bared to the world, dumped me in a room where a Dr proceeded to pour what I assume from the colour was iodine all over my vagina, then tugged my placenta out. I was left naked in a chair with my legs in stirrups for 4 hours with the door wide open. I finally got taken into a room and forget privacy curtains. There was a shower but they don't give you towels or soap or anything at all (a kind nurse brought me a nighty thankfully). And then in the morning the Dr and about 50 other people went around the ward and got you to bare all and pushed down on your stomach, I'll also add on that there were 6 beds in the room and all were occupied so everyone got to see each others vaginas oozing blood, thankfully we all just stared straight up at the ceiling the entire time. You're not allowed out the bed unless it's to use the bathroom or the room at all. Oh and they brought a lady in at around 3am, switched the lights on full power and made more noise than I'm positive they needed too. The staff in that hospital gave zero fucks lol",

Honestly, the nurses barging in every half hour were half the reason we fought so hard to leave..... We couldn't figure out how to nurse with them all over my spouse and baby. Neither of us could get any sleep and we'd been awake over 36 hours already. They wanted us to stay a full 24 and we managed to talk them into discharging same morning without us having to go AMA - just had to do a bilirubin test, confirm we had home midwife care lined up for the next day, and chat with a social worker briefly."

I shrieked and causes her to jump, scare the baby, and my husband. A nurse came in to check on us and once the boss left I snapped, \"Don't ever let someone in this god damn room without asking me first!\" I felt bad for yelling at that nurse as it's doubtful it was HER specifically but I was freaked the hell out.",

      "I learned this lesson so many years ago. There was a friend of mine growing up and I was always very jealous of her. She had it all. And then when we were in our teens, her dad left her mom for his secretary. Her life basically fell apart. She had worshiped her dad. I swore never to be jealous of anyone again, because you never know what their life really is. Now on Facebook, I find myself still a little depressed sometimes looking at her posts. I\u2019m basically 24/7 in pajamas with two little kids. She has her dream career, she\u2019s building this amazing compound on her enormous property. She has everything in life that I ever thought I wanted in terms of materialistic stuff. But I just found out that she has had a five year infertility problem that she\u2019s been dealing with as the Facebook pics of her beautiful property and her amazing job have been flooding my feed. So I\u2019m truly learning a lesson from her again. I am going to be happy for my friends going on vacations and building their careers and brushing their teeth on the daily. Because there\u2019s nothing, NOTHING in this world like when your baby puts their hand on your face and pats your cheek. Or gives you that first open mouth kiss on your chin. Or smelling your baby\u2019s hair while they are asleep on your chest. Now that I\u2019m thinking about it, though, I\u2019m going to go brush my teeth. \ud83d\ude05",

      "LOL this thread has triggered me. Before we had our baby, my husband and I loved to spend our evenings cooking a nice meal and eating it together. It took him way longer than it should have postpartum to realize that wasn't happening for the foreseeable future. He went back to work after two weeks. He worked from home which was great, but I was forgetting to feed myself during the day and he didn't notice. He was having breakfast and lunch but I wasn't with any kind of consistency so by dinner I'd be starving. At dinner he'd still cook elaborate meals and constantly ask me what we should have for dinner (at a couple weeks postpartum I truly did not give a fuck, figure it out bro) and what his 'timing' should be so he could have it ready when I'd be able to eat it. Like, I don't know my dude, if I could predict what a 3 week old was gonna do with any accuracy I'd definitely be monetizing that instead of sitting on this couch starving and suffering. I was also so annoyed he was making fancy dinners and making me wait for them while I was starving instead of just funnelling the lowest-effort calories possible directly into my mouth. Then he'd whine that we couldn't eat at the same time. I'd be begging him to just eat so he could take over with the baby, but he'd be like \"no I'll wait for you!\". I believe at one point I may have shouted him that eating together was an activity for people without newborns and he needed to get over it. Oh, and then cooking things that were messy and / or required two hands to eat. One night he made tacos (my absolute favorite) but he started them about two hours after I was already ravenous and the baby wouldn't let me put him down so I could eat them. I vividly remember snapping at him \"can you PLEASE get me something I can actually eat??\" and then ate a bag of Lays one-handed, sobbing, while my tacos got cold in front of me. I think that was the turning point for him because his expectations around dinner time got a lot more reasonable after that \ud83d\ude02 Poor guy. Incredible husband, amazing dad, and otherwise unbelievably supportive post-partum. This is really my one gripe with him during the newborn phase, he made eating way more complicated and stressful than it needed it to be at a time where I was just in survival mode. The good news is it isn't forever! At about 3 months old baby started letting me put him in the boppy at mealtimes so I could once again eat my beloved tacos. That was cathartic, good job OP!! \ud83d\ude02",
      "My husband does this, thankfully. But so does my dad (baby's grandpa) at any family dinners at home or restaurant. My dad said he remembers his dad helping with holding grandbabies so the parents could eat, and so he frequently does the same now that it's the next generation. I so appreciate it; his love language is definitely \"acts of service\" like that.",
      "My husband is actually amazing at this. Once we were at a BBQ at my sister's house and we both have babies around a similar age. My husband asked to have our baby so I could eat first but I said \"no, you eat\", besides she was content just sitting on my lap feeding herself. My husband absolutely wolfed down his food so he could grab our little one and let me eat in peace. Meanwhile, my sister was struggling holding her baby and trying to eat too. After seeing my husband grab our little girl she asked her partner to do the same. He responded: \"My friend is coming around now, and then we have to go and fix my motorbike\" and promptly left the table. I felt sorry for my sister, but I felt so much love and appreciation for my husband in that moment. My husband actually ended up walking around the garden with both babies that day to give both mamas a rest.",

SIL hesitates (this is not her child's grandparent), my mom says \"I'm the most expensive babysitter you can have while you eat, and you get me for free!\" SIL hands over baby and goes and eats. My mom later that day tells me, I wish people would have taken a baby from me when I had kids so I could eat, so I have no problem helping moms now. No matter who you are, you see a mom struggling?

I would say, be realistic on how your daughter will bond with the new baby, because they probably won\u2019t be friends growing up like children who are closer than age are.

      "Hey, sending hugs. I conceived my first after 3 cycles no problem, was shocked that it took a year for #2 (which I know is not technically infertility but seems similar to where OP is at). It\u2019s so hard to have your hopes raised and smashed every month for that long. I\u2019m sorry you are going through it. My husband and I were the same ages as you while TTC. My AMH sucked for a 35 year old but I was still ovulating regularly (trust me I became neurotic about my tracking methods). I ended up conceiving on cycle 11 or 12, immediately after an HSG (which showed no blockage). I have heard that can be common, maybe flushing something out, idk. I know it sucks so bad but I think in the end your chances are still pretty good. I wish I had better advice for coping but I didn\u2019t do well with it. There\u2019s lots of support at TTC30 but be sure to read their rules and lurk for a bit to get their vibe before posting."

The past 3 days (including today) have been so great. Make sure to send your child to the potty consistently every 30/45/60 minutes (whatever works for them; you will learn if they need to be sent more or less frequently pretty quickly). I had bought stickers for my daughter this time but the thrill of having peed in the potty is enough motivation for her. Don't make a big deal of accidents. Clean them up and move on.

I thought it was going to be a shit show but I was surprised! I skipped bath. Maybe do every other day with them? I didn\u2019t want to have to get baby out and leave sis in tub. So I cut it. Told big sis I was getting baby to sleep and I would be with her as soon as possible. She got a snack, put on her tonies, and \u201cread\u201d a book. By herself!!! I was shocked. I would get babe down, pop to sister, then when babe had a false start, I went back to babe. Big sis stayed in her room and quietly entertained herself. I was shocked!!! Big sis is never independent. It was amazing. Usually my mom comes over for bedtime, to help, but I didn\u2019t want to bug her. And the kiddos pleasantly surprised me!",

      "Ped nurse: might take two people for this depending on your kids\u2019 size and your own dexterity lol. This is the way I strong arm medicine into a kid. Have the medicine ready to go in arms reach. Hold the child like you\u2019re rocking a baby in a cradle hold, so they\u2019re on their back. This helps gravity get it to the back of their throat. You or someone else put syringe in mouth. Before starting to push the medicine, squeeze their lips like a fish. Do NOT let go of their cheeks. This is critical. Keeps them from being able to spit it out. You can give them breaks between swallows, but do not let go of those cheeks. Once you let go, they will spit it out and their cheeks will be slippery from medicine/tears/spit and you won\u2019t be able to get the hold back. If they start to cough, give them a break but don\u2019t let go of cheeks. If they start to gag, also give a break. If they throw up, try again later. Most important for this is that they won\u2019t hate you, and comfort them after. You have to do this for their own good, you are taking care of them and they need that to feel safe and loved. Don\u2019t feel bad about doing what\u2019s best for them. If all else fails, Tylenol rectal suppositories are available over the counter. And Frida makes a pacifier that a syringe can attach to, if your babe sucks on pacis that helps a ton! Sometimes helps to keep on top of meds too if they have a fever and feel crummy, they\u2019re more likely to be as cooperative (as developmentally possible) if they feel slightly better.",

You can give a tiny bit at a time and wipe it with your finger when he spits and put it right back in his mouth. We found the most success once he had been introduced to solids and was used to the idea that spoons would have weird and new flavors on them. I took a baby spoon, squirted a tiny bit of medicine from the dropper in it and let him eat it off the spoon. Did that over and over until my dropper was empty. Bonus is that I could use the spoon to wipe up any spillage and re-serve it.",

When they had tongue thrust reflex I put a little in and kept pushing it back into their mouth with the syringe to get them to swallow as much as possible. Same way they did the rotavirus vaccine.",

I\u2019ve also put it in frozen teethers that had berries in it to mask the taste. But if you really get desperate, depending on the age, you can do suppositories.",

My little one is used to the syringe now, that when I need to give her something, when she's teething badly, she'll open up her mouth. But sometimes I still need to close her mouth or it'll dribble out.",

      "Oh man that age is SO hard. 6-8 weeks is the peak of fussiness and crying. Look up \"purple crying\". But even babies that don't have colic or are purple cryers go through this development stage, it just varies in intensity. To some degree it is just a developmental stage to get through and remember it gets better. I had a really similar experience with my second. We had such a struggle getting him to calm down around eating we ended up going to a feeding therapist. The therapist didn't really help much because I think he just got overwhelmed with eating and needed to grow out of it. He also tended to only like the breast or bottle for periods of time. I ended up breastfeeding only from about 8 weeks to 6 months because it was too much of a struggle to have him get overwhelmed with two different feeding methods and I wanted to breastfeed because my first refused to breastfeed. In hindsight I wish I would have just switched to formula earlier because it was WAY too much to exclusively breastfeed a baby with feeding issues while also feeling like I was neglecting my 2.5 year old. It feels like having a toddler in the picture changes everything! And I agree pumping is the worst. That said, if you really want to keep breastfeeding I'd say just keep doing the \"bait and switch\" with the pacifier, calming techniques, feeding before hungry, etc. We got an exercise ball and bounced on that with him and that really helped. But a lot of it at that age is just do your best, get through it, and know that generally by 12 weeks things improve.",

      "I had these moments so many times! It\u2019s still happening post partum too but not nearly as often thankfully. The worst one was when my partner drank my last water bottle. I\u2019m super particular about water and I found the BEST tasting water at my midwives clinic but I couldn\u2019t get it anywhere else. When I woke up and found out she drank my magic water I lost it. I was sobbing, demanding an apology, couldn\u2019t even think straight because I was GRIEVING OVER WATER. Eventually we found the ONE place it\u2019s sold at. Literally the only way you can get it and it\u2019s at Home Depot of all places. Now I\u2019m doing a lot better with the hormones but it still does weird things even after birth so be prepared for that but it\u2019s 100% better than pregnancy hormones! If anyone is interested the water is Niagara brand :) https://preview.redd.it/2dmuk86a1w7f1.jpeg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25085a924d087a8d9bb45a687decab5ec72f3ccc",

So I ordered delivery and tacked something on for my husband so I\u2019d meet the delivery minimum. The delivery driver showed up with just his pizza and I sobbed so hard I couldn\u2019t breathe. And ofc it was delivered by a third party so they couldn\u2019t send it back out. I just had to hand my husband his pizza and watch his heart break for me (he ate it hiding in the kitchen after he\u2019d calmed me down). I still get teary eyes thinking about that night \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",

I picked through them meticulously to find the perfect pack, with no mold or squishy strawberries, perfectly ripe is what I\u2019m looking for. I put it in the cart. He decides that he wants to choose a different pack because it\u2019s a better price, and in searching through the options he grabs my *perfect* pack and it ends up mixed up on the shelf somewhere. He proudly tells me that he found some strawberries for a better price, and hands me the shittiest strawberries that are not even ripe.. like half of each strawberry was white. Cue the meltdown. Absolutely awful. I looked unhinged. Maybe I was \ud83d\ude02",

My eyes were closing during the day, it was a very difficult couple of weeks and I felt miserable. My boss agreed immediately and I was grateful. It was still tough to work but I could at least stay awake. My boss has been very nice and accommodating to all my requests, always saying \"don't hesitate to ask if you need something\", and as a people pleaser I wanted to reciprocate , to be as easy going as I could, and I didn't want to push too much with many requests. Essentially I asked what was *absolutely necessary* for me, but not what was *best* for me. I'm now at 14 weeks and I know that other women in my department had asked their doctors for a week off to properly rest during the first trimester. This would have helped me so so much. In the coming months I decided to change my attitude and always ask for what's best for me. Do ask people around you or online about what accommodation they got at work and if you feel like something would make a big impact on your wellbeing, do ask for it, even if you could cope without it.

Important question, just do establish context: Did he actually \"Yell\" as in raise his voice to a shout, or did he just adamantly push his opinion? Did he actually so those words or did you imply it from the context? As in, did he literally say the words \"You are being a bad parent\" to you? The reason I ask is I've been around a few people before with more sensitive personalities who tend to say \"X person said I was a Y\" when they didn't, they just said something that could maybe interpreted that way if you chose to take it the worst way it could have been interpreted. Same person would hand off a phone call and say \"I can't do it, this person is yelling at me\" and they were literally just asking her questions she couldn't handle or not immediately taking her word for everything and pushing for reasons or more detail. It sounds like the guy is a jerk, but OP, just checking on this. You're in a heightened state of sensitivity right now and his communication style or personality might not be well suited to accommodating that. Some people are just convinced there is one correct way to do something and everything else is wrong.",

Honestly, these absolute dweebs of partners who do nothing to stand up for their spouses is just insane. Why be in a relationship when you\u2019d let someone get railroaded like that?"

ARGH) and wrote down on a post-it note at my work computer that as far as I knew, baby was fine. My mom had 2 miscarriages and book-ending my two siblings and me so I reminded myself frequently that a miscarriage was roughly 25% likely from the get-go, and that there's nothing I can do to control that (many miscarriages are due to chromosomal abnormalities). I also just told a lot of people very early, including my priest. That 1) helped me feel like I'd be supported in the event of a miscarriage, and 2) made me feel like people were praying for a good outcome with me. I had pretty strong nausea from weeks 6 to 8 (at which point it almost entirely disappeared), some cramping, and really tender breasts. That helped but I tried to constantly remind myself that 1) as far as I knew, baby was fine, and 2) to emotionally prepare myself for a missed miscarriage (I do better acknowledging the risks and choosing to be positive than ignoring the risks).",

The second time, I had a panic attack at the ultrasound because of said PTSD, and it was made worse by seeing an empty sac again.

      "Whoa this does not seem correct. I am also a pregnant federal employee on FEP BCBS Basic, a plan I chose because it has amazing coverage for maternity care and delivery. It has no deductible and should cover all prenatal visits, lab diagnostics, and ultrasounds without a copay, and a flat $350 fee to give birth (vaginal or C-section); the only payment I've had was the office visit copay for confirmation of pregnancy. I would talk to both your OB's billing department and your insurance and make sure the OB is billing/planning to bill correctly to insurance. I had to get on the phone and sort out charges because my provider's office was billing with a non-maternity code to try and get more money out of my insurance company and I was getting stuck with copays; I told my provider I wasn't paying until they rebilled with the correct code and then it got fixed. I imagine your OB tries to foist this maternity fee on everyone regardless of insurance and see who just pays, so don't pay without asking a lot of questions. Also here's the full plan information if you need to cite your sources to justify why you don't need to pay that crazy fee: https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/healthcare/plan-information/plans/BrochureJson?brochureNumber=71-005&year=2025 Good luck!",

Then I graduated him to \"surfing\" at the park for tummy time, and he liked looking around. Sometimes and exclusively the first month I use the car seat on the stroller for our park walks-we have an active dog. But still use the car seat for errands and such on the stroller. Or a carrier. It's fairly lightweight, super easy to click in between car and stroller. And i think all car seats have belt path options? Also very easy. Which made traveling fine. What i have seen is that lots of parents buy the doona specifically for travel after the fact. You'll start bringing baby across the country to meet family and such, and it's apparently very useful for that. We had an easy time traveling with our stuff.

Or my husband likes to just free carry the baby when not in the car seat. I, however, use the stroller every single day. It's been great!",
      "I was so set on the Doona (or rather the even Flo which I liked better due to the wheels detaching) until I tried it out at Nordstrom and wow, the thing is pretty heavy and it didn\u2019t even have a baby in it. Even my husband was struggling a little and he\u2019s a big guy. Me personally I am not fit enough with the upper body strength to deal with it and I would be scared id drop the baby or something and that ruins the whole convenient ideal I had in my mind. I opted to get a travel stroller instead, specifically the Nuna TRVL LX with the pipa urban car seat. It was on sale as a bundle from Nordstrom and I love the easy one handed fold of the stroller, I love that the car seat doesn\u2019t need a base to be installed, and that I can use the stroller even when the baby outgrows the car seat.",
      "We got one for our third baby to use for daycare drop off and short errands, especially having the other kids with us if we are alone. No location we would go is more than 15mins away from our house. I plan to use our Nuna stroller from my previous kids for walks. My husband is way taller than me but he finds the height comfortable because the handle is tall. And the baby is low in comparison but they can see you really well which is nice. Since we won\u2019t be using it for longer walks the height doesn\u2019t really matter to us. The weight also isn\u2019t a big deal when we plan to use it for such a specific purpose. If I was using it for every stroller ride then I think it would be too heavy with a baby in it. But more than likely we will keep it in the car and load baby into/out of it, and only take it out of the car to go into daycare, to the pediatrician, etc. For a first baby I definitely wouldn\u2019t use it as an all purpose stroller. They will also outgrow it quickly! I would get a travel system for first baby, we loved our Nuna car seat that clicked into the stroller!",
      "My husband read up on those and we didn't get one for a few reasons 1. we are tall and it is impractically short for us 2. There was some conflicting information on the safety of the seats. We ended up going with the Uppa baby - its expensive but it came with the car seat, a bassinet, and the standard stroller seat. If we eventually end up having another it can also convert to a double stroller and the resale value is decent if we end up selling it. To us it was worth it and now using it I really love it. It's one of those \"if you have the funds do it, if not its not the end all be all\". For us the biggest plus is its great for tall people (I'm 5'8 and my husband is 6'3)",
      "I like the concept but ended up with a car seat/stroller set bc of the weight. Once my baby was maybe 3 or so months old, I didn\u2019t want her in the car seat as long, I wanted her to have the freedom of movement in a regular stroller. If you\u2019re going to be buying a stroller anyhow, I\u2019m not sure the doona makes sense for your situation? That being said, a lot of folks who have the doona love theirs so there\u2019s gotta be something good about them"
    ],
    "cons": [
      "I'm a huge doona hater. It's just not safe. Your baby shouldn't really be in it much when not driving. So if that's your only stroller, it's a problem",
      "My birth resulted in a really messed up pelvic floor. It was way too heavy for me and made it worse. Couldn\u2019t get it out of the car without help from my husband. Got an uppababy aria on super sale (6 lbs) and immediately felt better. Also a shitty stroller.",
      "I felt like it would be more practical to get the Uppababy minu v3 with the Uppababy aria. The aria car seat is very lightweight so much easier to carry. I can click it into the stroller if needed, or if I\u2019m afraid of leaving baby in the car seat for too long, i can put baby in the minu v3 from birth. Won\u2019t have to buy a new stroller for the baby once they outgrow the infant car seat. The minu is very compact so it not only takes up little trunk space but will fit in the overhead bin of an airplane, so I don\u2019t have to worry about airlines damaging my stroller."

      "I\u2019ve had both and honestly both were wonderful. My vaginal made me feel like a total badass who can do very hard things, golden hour was beautiful, and I really appreciated my ability to move strong right after delivery ( induction without pain meds). My c-section went pretty smooth\u2014I was holding my baby 2 hours after arriving to the hospital, I felt instant connection with my baby and the recovery was better (planned section).",
      "I'm not going to comment on \"which is better\" because I dont fit your criteria BUT I will say the mental side of why people have done both is an important factor. In the US, from what ive heard, women who had a c-section first have to really advocate and fight for themselves to have a VBAC. When you really had to fight for something, I feel like your more likely to agree its the best way. On the flipside, women who had vaginal birth then elective c-section probably wanted the elective c-section for a reason so are going to have a more favorable view. Its a really interesting question and I love hearing all the responses. It just goes to show theres no \"right\" way to deliver! I really hope this doesnt sound preachy because its not my intention. I just like musing about this stuff.",
      "I had both. I think the most important thing is to be in align with your healthcare provider about what is more safe for you (your body) and the baby. My first was a very traumatic delivery ending with a 4th degree tear, 7 fractures in my spine and thankfully the most beautiful healthy baby. That being said, recovery took forever- I wasn\u2019t walking well until 5 months pp and before we had a second child we consulted a handful of professionals. We spoke to a spine doc, a therapist (obviously), gyn, urogyn, etc. With their input we decided that if a 2nd was in the cards for us it would be a c section and before we got pregnant we found a provider who not only agreed with that but also defended it on my chart. Our provider also helped me make a birth plan in case they were not on call if I went into labor. My c-section was a breeze comparatively. The pain was well managed with medicine and we worked hard to make sure my bowels were moving before we left the hospital (they had me walking and on an intense bowel regimen). I was walking around the day after and able to get around the house and up and down the stairs etc and small walks very quickly. I now have a scar and the accompanying stretch marks but I\u2019m proud of them and my body for bringing our second child into the world. Overall, the most impactful thing was that my provider and I evaluated my health and body and made a plan to keep me healthy and safe. Now we have 2 absolutely beautiful children and I wouldn\u2019t change a thing.",
      "Both my mother and my MIL had a c section and then a VBAC. When I was pregnant with my first, my mom was like \"definitely try for a vaginal birth, it's WAY easier!\" And my mother in law was like \"definitely just schedule a c section, it's WAY easier!\" So I think it's probably pretty person/baby dependent.",
      "I know three women who have vaginal births or tried to. One ended up with third degree tearing with terrible recovery and two had to have emergency C Sections after labouring for long time. One of them opted for a C section for her second and I\u2019m pretty sure the other will too. One of them was poker and prodded to much over the 50 hour labor and bled profusely. So you are someone who is comfortable with uncertainty and has a higher risk tolerance, vaginal delivery might be for you. If you like predictability, C Section is the way to go. From what I\u2019ve heard, a scheduled C Section and recovery is much much better than an emergency one. I don\u2019t know the science behind it. Also, if you want three or more kids, C Section might be limiting as it is only advised, preferably, for two kids. In certain cases, like transverse baby, IUGR or a big baby, C Section is just safer all around. I believe younger women tend to do better with vaginal deliveries than older ones - but that might be bias within my circle of acquaintances. I wish there was a test that could tell us which would be best for each woman!"

      "So I had a vaginal birth with my daughter, and for that, I was induced and labored a long time. It was terrible, and recovery for me was extremely difficult. For my son, I knew I'd have a c-section due to placenta previa, but a week before my planned surgery, I suffered a placental abruption and had an emergency c-section. Even with that trauma, my c-section recovery was so much easier on me mentally and physically. I'm not sure if the difference is that I had no experience with birth for my 1st and that's why it was so difficult. But the physical recovery for my vaginal birth (stitches from a 2nd degree tear, hemorrhoids, lochia) seemed way worse to me than my c-section. And the induction factor may contribute to some of my feelings about my vaginal birth because that was horrible (couldn't eat, IVs, etc.). At my follow-up appointment, the provider mentioned me being a good candidate for VBAC since I've had a successful vaginal birth but I don't know if I'd attempt that. So there's my opinion FWIW.",
      "My vaginal birth went entirely off the rails - significant hemorrhage, pitocin, a 2nd degree tear. I had to get a blood transfusion. But recovery wasn\u2019t bad at all after the blood transfusion. My c-section was due to my daughter being breech. It was fast, controlled, no surprises. I was able to hold my baby while getting stitched up. The post op pain was awful, I definitely needed significant pain management the first 2-3 days and I felt much less equipped to parent my newborn in the immediate weeks following the birth. I\u2019m about to have my 3rd and I\u2019m heavily leaning towards a VBAC just because the c-section recovery was a lot - but if there\u2019s any suspicion that a vaginal birth is going to get complicated again I\u2019ll probably just accept the C.",
      "I prefer the c-section delivery and the vaginal recovery. The problem is that every experience will be vastly different. I had complications with my vaginal delivery and left the delivery room feeling traumatized and like I got hit by a truck, the recovery sucked because they used the vacuum to deliver and I had a second degree tear but I wasn\u2019t in as much pain and functional sooner. The c-section was a breeze and I felt great after the surgery until the pain hit and it seemed like nothing could touch it, just turn the intensity down. I then developed a seroma, which opened up my incision and I\u2019ve been leaking bodily fluid since my first week pp and I\u2019m seven weeks now. It\u2019s healing and closing up but it\u2019s been a slow process. I had to be on antibiotics which made me sick, gave me a sun burn like rash, and made my ears and face swell up for a few days. Both deliveries sucked in their own way. I\u2019m not really sure which I would do again. They took my tubes so it\u2019s safe to say I never want to be pregnant or deliver a baby ever again.",
      "I had an emergency c section and a VBAC with episiotomy. I had a much worse recovery after my CS than the episiotomy, though it did hurt to sit for a bit if I overdid things. I would try for a vaginal birth again if I had another baby.",
      "I\u2019ve had both; c-section for breech baby with my first and a VBAC with my second. I much preferred my vaginal delivery. Even with an episiotomy and horrendous hemorrhoids, recovery was much faster and less uncomfortable. My c-section experience wasn\u2019t bad and recovery wasn\u2019t horrendous either, but based on my experience with both, I\u2019d choose vaginal again."

      "You need to stop expecting your friends to drop everything and cater to your emotional needs. They have lives outside of you. Be they college students, full-time workers or mothers. Having friends is a blessing in life, a transient one, and not a god-given right. I give my friends space when they have something going on and expect the same when I am busy. At times something exciting was occurring in my life and may have been brought up in conversation often, same goes with my friends that have something exciting occurring. Be it a new job, a new guy, a new kid, a stressful life event, or even a crazy new dog. If I am in a social mood, but find most of my friends a little occupied, I expand my social life and get out more. I am not \u201cowed\u201d their attention. I don\u2019t give myself to them as a bargaining token to ensure a return. I am genuine and authentic, respecting their boundaries and needs and my own. I never extend myself further than I wish, and so I never am taken advantage of. I never give anything I didn\u2019t want to lose. I don\u2019t \u201cmake\u201d time I genuinely don\u2019t have to spare. I never place someone on a pedestal, so they never \u201cfall\u201d in my eyes. If someone drifts away from me, or I from them. Such is life! We\u2019re all living it, and shit gets busy, people change, you change. What will be, will be. When a coworker was pregnant, we didn\u2019t pretend interest. We were happy for her, and wanted to participate in supporting her with such a big life event. We got her a big box of wipes/diapers and calmoseptine. When a male coworker\u2019s wife was having a baby, we got him stuff they didn\u2019t get in their baby shower. When he came to work exhausted, we had patience and picked up the difference for a short time. When he brought his wife and baby up to work, we took pictures because his baby was adorable. I keep candy in my office for my client\u2019s who bring their kids because it makes me happy to see their faces light up. They\u2019re cute when they\u2019re shy. They\u2019re cute when they\u2019re excited. If someone is sharing stories about their kids I\u2019m not being disingenuous when I ask to see pics. Usually I wind up sharing stories of my friend\u2019s kids or my little niece. When one of my friends becomes a new mom, I usually provide acts of service rather than meet up for cosmos. Because everyone is telling her that she\u2019s strong, and that she\u2019s got this, but most new moms truly just need some assistance. Simple help with small tasks. I visit at their place and bring coffee, and we gab and catch up. Since their lives have now expanded to include little one\u2019s this means, interruptions, and \u201coops excuse me a moment\u201d as they tend to their kids. So conversation halts and circulates a bit with the distractions. I don\u2019t go over there and expect her to ignore her children, and drop everything so I can finish my story about the guy who scratched my car in the parking lot. In fact, if I had a friend that completely ignored her kids, and let them climb and jump off dressers while we visited and talked in the kitchen, I probably would lose respect for her.... I don\u2019t get to see them as often as my single friends with no kids, so I make the best of our time, and usually I wash dishes, clean counters, and help with laundry while we b.s. and gab. Because I can hike and catch up, go for dog walks and catch up, eat at a restaurant and catch up, help them pack and move to a new place and catch up, or help them tidy their house and catch up. If I call a friend back at the end of week, and ask \u201cso how\u2019s the baby ears now with the tubes in, has she had anymore ear infections\u201d? It\u2019s because I DO GENUINELY care. I don\u2019t like seeing her baby cry in pain, and remember how stressed my friend was running her up to the doctors when her ears became infected again and again. Maybe it\u2019s time you unplug from social media? I haven\u2019t had a facebook in about 6 years now as I found it to be a facetious form of socializing. It was refreshing to get back to basics, and regain my authenticity. Perhaps you\u2019d be a little less detached and bitter.",
      "As someone who's never had a child, but many friends have: I'm happy for you, I truely am, but I have my own life to lead. It's the most important thing to ever happen *to *you* most likely, and that's fine, but you shouldn't expect everyone around you to bend over backwards to make you feel it is for them too. As a friend, we totally care, and if anything were to go wrong we'd be there for you, but this is a natural part of life, it's amazing for you, it's standard for everyone else, and *that's okay*. You enjoy it as much as you want too but recognise it's not everyone else's biggest thing ever, and that doesn't mean they don't care.",

I'm very used to being self sufficient and am not sure how I'd handle asking people to help me tidy up or throw in a load of laundry. I joked about writing a list, so if people asked how they could help I would have an answer, but really I cringe at the thought. My plan is to go into it with the best of expectations. Hopefully my husband and I will be able to keep a handle on basic chores/hygiene and visitors will respect that we might not want them to come over all the time, through what could be nap/chore time, and not help out. But if we're clearly sinking, I hope I'm able to ask a friend to help.

Occasionally all of the above, it's kind of amazing really. My friends on the other hand ask anytime they wanna buy something specific: 1. If I need it 2. If I have it already in any size or form 3. Which size I need/want (clothes/diapers) 4. Whether I have a preference in color/materials 5. If I can fit the object in our space.

We basically did a Montessori-style nursery with a floor bed, a mobile hung from the ceiling, a play mat, and minimal furniture (only a low shelf for toys). [Sample](https://rebellekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DSC_0112-2-1.jpg) It's a LOT more child-friendly and free than typical nurseries, which are designed more for the adults than the babies.

      "For those complaining that it's only xx% and it's only paid bc it comes out of your income automatically - I (personally) WISH that was the case here in the US. I WISH it was law across the board. Some states offer disability (like CA) thats only PARTIAL of your salary, for 14 weeks (recently increased from 12 weeks) because it comes out of your pay. I moved to AZ, where there's no pay at all. And my job doesn't have enough employees to be covered under FMLA, which simply ensures I have a job to come back to. Luckily, I have a job that implemented a policy that secures my job simply because of me. But a lot of you that are saying you did get paid is because your state offers it at a %, or even some businesses offer this on their own (which is nice!) but it's not across the board. Even when it is partially paid, it's only for a few weeks. I had to go back from my UNPAID leave after 8 weeks and I'm still dealing with doctors and whatnot. For those complaining about \"paying\" for it with your tax dollars. Let's be real. We are going to be taxed no matter what and do we REALLY know what the gov't is doing with our $$ anyway? LOL I would love to have even a partial amount to be able to take off for a whole year! it's hard to leave your newborn with strangers (for most). Some people are ready to go back to work ASAP, but not everyone is. and it'd be nice to have the option.",

I've been stashing anything extra aside and will be just staying home till we ring in the new year. Luckily we live well within our means and can survive on my hub's income, otherwise we'd be screwed. For a country with individuals who bust their asses at their jobs and careers, we really have no extras to show for it.

So if you never worked and never made contributions, you don\u2019t get paid mat leave. They make deductions at virtually any job you work and you get paid a percentage of your average income. If you have good benefits through your employer, you get topped up to full pay (or somewhere close to full pay) for part or all of your leave.

It used to be 2 weeks for maternity and 1 week of paternity at first, but I\u2019m sure some poor, poor man complained about the inequality, because a few years later (with no explanation or warning) maternity and paternity were both one week in the handbook. So many US companies give zero weeks for maternity leave. You are all correct - companies don\u2019t give a fuck. It\u2019s not mandatory so they don\u2019t do it.",

      "He\u2019s bad at math. It\u2019s 245 minimum. (35 weeks of parental leave at 55%, or you can take extended parental leave which is 61 weeks/427 days at 33%). Additionally there\u2019s another 5 weeks/8 weeks (depending on if you choose standard or extended leave) that your partner can take if they qualify for EI Parental leave benefits. So basically there\u2019s: 40 weeks of standard benefits at 55%, but limited to 35 weeks for one person. Or 69 weeks at 33%, but limited to 61 weeks for one person."

      "So I should say first I 100% agree with everyone here- you get to choose who is in the room and no one should ever assume they are invited nor should they ASK! I\u2019m \u201cyeah girl!\u201dReacting to all the fantastic comments here. Ironically, I came close to asking my MIL to be in town in case I needed her in the room. Husband and I had some major marital problems right before baby girl was born and I briefly had doubts he would be there for her birth. It was fleeting thank god and looking back there wasn\u2019t ever really a chance but it felt super real for a short while there, so much so I had to think about what I would do. So I really thought about having MIL there- but I really love her and she\u2019s an OBGYN nurse practitioner and very level headed and supportive. I had one of my best girlfriends come instead. And yes husband was there. My mother on the other hand. No f-ing way. In fact she thought she would be invited a couple days ahead to be in the waiting room and be the first to meet baby girl, because it\u2019s al about her and that\u2019s her sacred right as the grandmother right??!? No. I told her she could fly in three days later. Thank god we live on opposite coasts. And she knows I would have had her blacklisted from the hospital (if that\u2019s possible...)",
      "People who want to be in the waiting room or the labor room (besides the pregnant woman\u2019s partner) seem to think of this as a fun spectator sport party for the baby\u2019s birth. They forget that it is also a major medical event that can go south for baby or mom quickly. The woman needs space and privacy, and support from those she chooses, for this, and the medical professionals need room to work. My SIL had postpartum hemorrhage and my brother left the room to call my mom about the birth while his wife was bleeding. My mom didn\u2019t get it and kept him on the phone as he repeated he needed to check on his bleeding wife. I was also on the call (visiting my mom, on another extension of the landline) and had to end the call for my mom! (Also his fault for calling that moment and not hanging up!) People just don\u2019t get that childbirth isn\u2019t all fun and happy baby, or that pushing takes more time and effort than in the movies :) Even a year after my birth my MIL was pushing for the fun \u2018going into labor story.\u2019 I redirected and kept in vague and she kept asking! She shut up when I explained that I was having routine ultrasounds because my BP had gone up and they found my fluid was low and I had to be induced immediately because it wasn\u2019t safe to keep baby inside any longer. Sorry to ruin your fun fantasy story about feeling contractions and water breaking at the grocery store or something. :P This got ranty. Sorry!",
      "So thankful that my husband: 1. Doesn\u2019t have the best relationship with his parents 2. Is super apathetic about the birth and is just saying \u201cwhatever you want babe\u201d to all of my decisions \ud83d\ude02",
      "I\u2019d like to see my hubby force me to do ANYTHING while I\u2019m in labor \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
      "I actually kicked my own mom out! (Still feel a little bad about it.) I was trying to push and she kept petting my leg and telling me everything was okay and to relax. I love my mother (she's amazing!) but being naked from the waist down made it weird and it was definitely not time to relax! *Pushing a baby out here, mom!* Finished the task with my husband and the awesome nurse at my sides. That's how I'll have it in any future birthplans."

      "We kept telling all our family that no one was going to be allowed in the delivery room. I even went as far as saying we wouldn't even let them know I was in labor until our little guy was out and we were ready for visitors. My mom several times asked to be told when it was happening so she could be in the waiting room. \"But not in the delivery room!\" Well, I had to be induced. So we told everyone not to come until we give the green light and that our phones will be on Silent because I didn't want to be texting as I'm pushing a human out of my body. We went in Thursday night, they tried a balloon, the next morning I wasn't dialated enough and they were going to administer pictocin. I called my mom to give her an update. And told her I'd call when i had him That was around 10am. By 4, I was pushing and he was out at 4:59. At 5:10ish, he's still on my stomach, im exhausted, husband and I are bonding with him and a nurse comes up and says 'grandma is right outside the door. Can she come in?' They *let her past the security doors* and was right outside the delivery room. It was in our birth plan that no one would be allowed in there. I was too tired to be mad but thankfully my mom left without coming in. She said her excuse was she hadn't heard from me all day and she was worried I had to go in for a C-section and she just needed to know I was ok. For fuck sake. It was a fast delivery. 7hours isn't all day. Calm the fuck down. Once we were home we got a survey in the mail about our experience and I wrote about my lack of privacy. Haven't heard back. Sorry, not really the topic here but it just got me all riled up again. Your body, your baby. Your choice who gets to be there.",
      "Also that poor woman may yet have a nasty birth - deep tearing, haemorrhage, emergency caesar, stillbirth... None of us knows how our birth will go. Having a viewing gallery could make any of that trauma 10x worse. We often barely even know our in laws and someone wants them to be there for what could turn into either the best or the worst moment of your life?! Hell no.",
      "With my first it was my mom and my ex (then boyfriend) in the room. With the next I\u2019ll probably still ask my mom to be there, but my husband is sure as shit going o be there lmao His mom is a piece of shit so there\u2019s no way she\u2019s going to even know I\u2019m in labor, let alone pregnant. She\u2019s not even invited to the wedding. No way that psycho is coming near my kids",
      "Ugh this happened with my last delivery except my parents and while family wanted to be in the room. I told them I didn't want then there until I had the baby and they could wait in the waiting room and they never showed up and called my fiance awful names. It made my stay at the hospital very sad",
      "I'm not letting my in-laws anywhere near me for a MONTH postpartum. They were AWFUL last time, and I'm never letting them bully me ever again. Luckily they aren't the type to just show up, so I don't think it will be an issue, but I've told my husband that if they do show up in that month, they DO NOT get to see the baby. &#x200B; They descended 4 days postpartum from a unplanned c-section. Thank god they weren't staying with us, but were over nearly every day for HOURS, and I was seriously guilt tripped about not wanting them around \"they drove all this way to SEE THE BABY\". My MIL would sit there and criticize and argue with me about all my parenting decisions, nag me that my baby was hungry, harp on about how I wasn't giving her a daily bath, be judgmental about my hard recovery was (unplanned c-section that got INFECTED), harp on about how I wasn't driving yet (even though we told her that it's car insurance not letting me drive for six weeks), and not lift one finger to help AT ALL. I was so emotionally vulnerable that I wasn't able to stand up for myself, so it's created huge strain in our relationship, as well as my relationship with my husband. I am still hurt that he didn't stand up for me, and let his mother steamroll me. He's apologized, but I haven't truly seen him stand up to her yet, so it's still an issue. So yeah, they aren't allowed to come for A MONTH."

      "I'm sure this will be very unpopular, as I can see from comments, this appears to be an almost lynching of any father who do not meet your expectations. I somehow stumbled on this headline and explored the comments. I'll share my story, and I'm sure it'll be received as some kind of misogynistic view point. But I just wanted to share my experiences as a father, separated from his child for many of the beliefs that have been stated in this sub. Growing up, many male role models were few and far between, TV sure as shit didn't paint fathers in any kind saintly aura. Many, if not all fatherly figures on any kind media were all made to look like idiots. Not doing anything other than goofing off. You can see in any TV advert, billboard or poster. Dads are idiots apparently. So when my partner mentioned she wanted to have a child, I was incredibly nervous. Hesitant. Because I knew I wasn't quite mentally prepared. I told her we should talk about it more, and I want to understand what's to come. Little did I know, she stopped taking her contraception. She didn't tell me. And within a month, I found out I was going to be a dad, but not by mutual decision. I was in this place of shock, now being thrust into this sea of the unknown, you see most men, from my experience, do not grow up thinking about having children, of course you know, we want to be able to have a family, a home, pets etc. Eventually, But we most certainly did not talk about all the finer details, in which, through observations of other women approaching my pregnant partner, seemed to willing share, without being asked for it. So now, with the realization of what's to come, my brain didn't think about learning how to change nappies or doing house work. It became how I now have to find a way of securing the means of which I support my new young family. I had to extend my hours at work as builder/business owner, heavily taxing both mentally and physically. To make sure my family was never going to be struggling. As time went by and my partner, now heavily pregnant, was on maternity leave. I was still pushing as hard as I could to ensure our home necessities were met, while also trying my best to support her needs as well. We had our beautiful baby girl, in the middle of NZs first covid lock down. I was only allowed to be present for less than an hour after her birth, for a quick cuddle, then I was told to leave. Naturally I was devastated, but relieved to see our healthy baby girl and mum were well. I didn't see them for 2 days afterwards. I tried to call many times, but only a couple of calls came back. It honestly made me feel like I didn't matter, I'm just a father after all.. Not important. After 2 days, when I went to pick the up from hospital, I was so excited to see my family. I was there an hour early. I couldn't wait to be able to hold her in my arms and say \"Hi, I'm your dad\". When i finally got to see her, I cried with joy. But that was cut short by \"you didn't bring the right blanket\" right off the bat. Barely held her a few minutes and already I wasn't doing something right. For one week, I was allowed to be at home before my paternity leave run out, I tried my best ensure mum and bubs were looked after. You can think about it, and read about it all you want but when it comes to putting it to practice. Everything just goes out the window. I remember the first time I tried to change a nappy. This tiny little fragile thing, I didn't do a very good job of it, I was so incredibly nervous, I was constantly on edge, what if I hurt her by accident? Am I doing this right? It was my first ever nappy change in my 36 years of life. But before I could have another attempt, I was told to move with a sigh and I was left feeling incredibly stupid at my failure to do what mothers find so simple. I built the house we lived in, but at that moment I was just an idiot man who couldn't change a nappy. This was the beginning of my experience of being a father. Throughout her first year of life, I was working, a lot. We were now down to a single income. But I convinced myself that that was my role, I had to provide for my family. But as time went by and the broken sleep and long hours, it eventually took its toll. I wasn't able to be as supportive around the house as I was expected to be, I was quite literally wrecked come what little weekend I got. I would try to get as much daddy daughter time in as i could. And sure enough, these expectations of me were not being met. But when I offered to help, I was told not bother. Just go sit down. Not in a caring supportive way, but anger. Then when I didn't offer to help, I wasn't being supportive enough. I was always grateful for my partner, in how she looked after the home and our child. I thought I was pretty lucky. But, I was never awarded the same courtesy, it was just \"expected\". I wanted to be more involved with my child's upbringing, I often asked about how or which way we were going to be doing so. But I was always met with anger, \"how dare he ask how I'm going to raise my baby\" that last quote is actually what I overheard on a phone call to her mother. I was never allowed to have a say in how our baby was being raised. Another time she said \"I'm the mother, stop asking\" when i asked how long she intends to co-sleep and another time she told me \"for the first 2 years of a baby's life, dads don't matter\".. little by little, the joy and excitement of being a father was slowly eroded away. I love my daughter to death, do not mistake this. But I found it so difficult to be the father I was expected to be, instead of being allowed to be the dad I wanted to be, that I found it hard to connect with my daughter. So, after being continually beaten down, told I wasn't meeting her expectations, I wasn't doing enough. she decided she wasn't happy and decided to leave me. Just like that, I lost my identity. My reason for being. I was discarded, as if I didn't contribute a thing. Now I only get to see my daughter on the end of a vid call and for 3hrs Saturday and Sunday. I get to be a dad for 6hrs a week. Those 6hrs are my most treasured time. Because it's just me, my daughter, no pressures or expectations. Just us, it's actually the only time I've felt like a real father. But, when I say this to people I am INSTANTANEOUSLY looked at like a dead beat dad. I did all I could to make sure my family was safe, warm, fed, clothed and homed. I guess that doesn't deserve any kind of appreciation in this day and age. So forgive me, if I can't just not say anything. I just don't understand how we can be seen as something you can just throw away so easily.. Sincerely A father for 6 hours.",
      "I agree with all of this but also try to give grace because within one generation the bar for dads has gone from, they don\u2019t beat their kids and are the breadwinner so they\u2019re a good dad, to really being expected to be a full partner in childcare (not to say our dads generation didn\u2019t have its fair share of great involved dads, but my dad who until recently I always thought of as a great dad, I now realize didn\u2019t do shit until we were old enough to do homework, etc) My husband had no role models for what being a dad looked like. He didn\u2019t grow up babysitting/nannying and being around grownups talking about baby care, like I was exposed from my mom and aunts and older cousins. He wasn\u2019t enculturated to pay attention to baby care via dolls and shows and every message about motherhood. There is SO MUCH latent knowledge I had about taking care of a baby from before I ever got pregnant. He was literally starting from zero. THAT SAID. He cooks and cleans and takes care of a lot of our lives and is trying with baby stuff, but I\u2019m still carrying the baby mental load (so yea, I am leaving him instructions when I go on this three night trip, but *I am leaving him with the baby* and I trust him)",
      "While this is an issue we are all well aware of there is an important factor being completely ignored it seems. While you state no one is born to know all these things you do skip out on something the majority of women have that these same men do not. History. Western sociatally when we are younger little girls are given, at a very young age, dolls of all kinds. Many of which got \"baby\" dolls be they the ones that do nothing to the ones that do awkward bodily functions. From a very young age these same girls are given a starter baby to play and cuddle with while younger boys are completely devoid of this. And this type of thing continues as we age too. Girls get more dolls to take care of and boys are given, what almost seems like, distraction toys. Action toys of all types but none of these toys ever are caring toys. Toys made to be coddled and cared for, girls toys on the other hand promote exactly that. Another notable thing is babies and kids. Rarely is the young boy around the baby u less it's a younger sibling or even requested to cuddle and hand around with a baby. Younger girls seem to, obviously by now, already *want* to be around this baby whoever they may be. They want to hold cuddle etc mostly because of being subliminally taught to feel this way. The young boy...well he's over there playing with toys while the rest of the family oggles over \"the baby\" So this continues as we age. Family events? Men are left to their own devices when someone brings over a baby whole the women of the family are surrounding this baby. Things are getting better as time progresses as a society, especially with the newer generations, but the generation having kids now (mostly millennial) were \"taught\" by the prior one who acted and cared for their kids like the above. So these things ARE factors and to ignore them is being a bit naive. For other things we have similar examples. For instance, my wife's parents didn't really teach her to do anything kitchen wise be it cooking or grocery shopping etc while I have all of that and do 99% of our cooking. While she can and does try to learn more of these things I have leagues more experience in the kitchen than she does. And while I'm a dummy when it comes to babies and am trying desperately to get myself in that mind set, I'm effectively starting at point zero at 31 while being \"expected \" to learn all of these things I was never taught at a younger age to even care about or consider. It's tough. So while this is each of our \"first baby\" it's not entirely the same \"first baby\"",
      "100%. It\u2019s so sad to see women describing their partners as \u2018amazing\u2019 or saying how lucky they are when in reality they\u2019re just doing their fair share as any person in a partnership should. The bar is so low. Clementine Ford is a brilliant writer who talks about this a lot- her recent take on it is sad but true (this is from her FB) \u201cHow can men support their partners after they have a baby? This is a long one but I loved answering this question, and I think it\u2019s so important. I wish more men would ask questions like this, and I hope they really listen to the answer. If the response in my DMs from women is anything to go by, this answer deeply resonated with them and their experience. So many of us feel/felt SO LET DOWN by the lack of true partnership we received after we became mothers. We\u2019re told to be a mother is \u201cthe most important job in the world\u201d, but this isn\u2019t at all reflected in the way motherhood itself is actually viewed and treated. It\u2019s \u201cthe most important job in the world\u201d, and yet it\u2019s also \u201cnot that big a deal, women do it everyday, get over yourself\u201d. Maternity leave is a big old bludge, right? We just sit at home and watch TV and have a nice holiday! WRONG. Pregnancy, birth and caring for a newborn are some of the most demanding and gruelling things a person can put their body through. If you feed your baby from your own body, you\u2019re looking at around 8-10 hours a day of milk feeding and production. That is labour, and it\u2019s been valued at $3.6 BILLION a year to the Australian economy. Motherhood is work - and just because it is unpaid (convenient!) it does not mean it is meaningless or unchallenging. So one of the most valuable things new fathers can do to support their partners *and their babies* is recognise that this is work. And when they leave to go to their jobs every day, they are taking a break from that work. That means when they return from their job, their work starts. Not just caring for the baby, which they must do as soon as they walk in the door, but taking on the bulk of the household work too. Do not ever chastise the mother of your child for the house being messy. How dare you, especially when I *know* from listening to women talk over the years how many of you also \u201cwon\u2019t let her\u201d pay for a cleaner - because you think *she* should do it all for free. Do the laundry, mate! And let\u2019s talk about sleep. Men\u2019s sleep is not more valuable. Yes, I understand there are circumstances where men in labour intensive jobs may need to have sleep to ensure safety - but until Australian workplaces provide adequate paid paternity leave (that all men are also willing to take), they will have to be willing to negotiate this in a way that is fair and equitable to both parties. Mothers need sleep too - they\u2019re doing \u201cthe most important job in the world\" after all. But more than anything, if men don\u2019t recognise these truths, they need to accept that women will one day leave them. As soon as they\u2019re able to, as soon as they aren\u2019t crushed by the intensity of caring for a newborn and then a toddler, they will leave. Because they will feel so fundamentally let down that they won\u2019t be able to bear it anymore. The resentment will begin to poison them and everything they ever thought was good about that person, and all they\u2019ll feel is rage and hatred. So I ask men: do you want your partners to hate you? Do you want them to feel let down by you? Do you want them to know that, when it really counted, you failed them? If the answer to those questions is a resounding no, I urge you to listen to this advice. And if you don\u2019t believe me, listen to other women. Because as much as you might not believe me here, I don\u2019t hate men and I don\u2019t want them to suffer. I just want them to be better. For women. For children. And for themselves.\u201d",
      "I am 44M and I 100% agree with OP. There are some things my wife is better at than me and some things I'm better than her so we tag team and cover each other as best we can.

I can't get every room but I get what I can. I figured put how to clean the toilet and sink and part of the tub. I had to relearn how to do these basic chores when I could very easily say \"I can't do it\", but I struggled and adapted until I could. If I can do that then there is no excuse for any man to say he doesn't know how to do something. I have male friends who boast about getting out of child care chores by being really bad at it.

      "While I don\u2019t disagree with your point I also feel a lot of women can hold on to the way they do things as the _right_ way, and then think everything their partner do is wrong. There are many ways to change a diaper - my OHs way is different to mine, doesn\u2019t make it wrong and I need to allow him the space to explore and find his way, rather than giving detailed instructions on how I do it and criticise his efforts. The same with doing a girls hair. I hate that I always end up doing it - so when he does it, no matter how awful or clumsy - it\u2019s perfect for that day. He will find his way with practise and patience. When I leave the house I never leave instructions. He is a parent and can figure it out."

The carpet is, in fact, a giant pair of disembodied ballerina legs that Dr. Possum *promises* me were grassfed. Nice catch. :) \\*Montessori inspired because they are actually made of edible toxic plastic that lights up like strobe lights, but look wooden, which Dr. Possum said is better for baby because it releases thetans from the baby's aura.",

      "When I had my first, my organization was located in a VERY old, outdated building. There was no space to pump, so I was told to use one of the C-level exec's offices day-by-day, as they are often out on travel. Let me tell you- there's nothing more awkward than sitting in the Director of the company's office to pump (nevermind that I got walked in on twice by his secretary, despite the locked door AND sign). By the time I had my second, we had moved into a new modern building with a dedicated space for pumping. I got a ton of say in putting the pumping room together since I was pregnant at the time. Our current pumping room has lockers, a leather recliner, a swivel tray, sanitizing wipes, a nice (easily washable) rug, a mini-fridge, a desk lamp for softer lighting than the florescent, some tree and butterfly decals, and a sound machine. My heart SWELLS when a new mom comes back to work and is grateful for the room and how it's set up.",
      "I work for a large corporation that has GREAT breastfeeding acceptance in their handbook! When I told HR I was planning on breastfeeding she told me she would set me up with an office, a comfy chair, and everything I needed! After baby was born, once again told she would set me up with a great room to pump in! Then I mentioned milk storage and she asked me if I HAD to refrigerate it and NOT to store it in the employee refrigerator in the break room - where else am I supposed to store it?! I seriously think she thought I was going to put bags of breastmilk just on a shelf in there! Then I came back from leave, my very first shift, and there was NO WHERE for me to pump! So they rushed and asked which manager had an office to spare for a few breaks. So now, I\u2019m pumping in one of my male managers office who seems very awkward with me since using his office. All it has in it is a metal desk with a phone, a TON of random papers, and a random gift bag with a mug in it. It\u2019s also got a few random boxes that showed up. The lock on the door doesn\u2019t work half the time (no ones walked in on me thankfully). There\u2019s NO garbage can and when I asked about one they said there\u2019s one in the hallways I can use. It also has a LIFESIZE gingerbread man in the corner by the desk, I have a picture if no one believes me. Last week a large shelf on wheels full of random things showed up right in front of the desk so now I have to put my pump bag on top of random boxes. A few days ago a pair of his shoes was right in the small walkway to the desk. The office is right next to the main manager and I can always hear him talking whenever I go to pump. It\u2019s also awkward when there\u2019s a room full of managers in the conference room next door and I hear them talk knowing that they can all hear me pump! It is not cozy at all. I have a pregnant manager and a pregnant HR that both plan on breastfeeding. I wonder how long after they have to start using that office that it\u2019ll somehow get cleaner and nicer. I figure HR will just pump in her office.",

Also, just in case, I recommend a power strip if there's not one already (for pumping, phone and laptop chargers, etc.) And if the company pays for it, a mini fridge/freezer.

      "This is great. There is still a lot of discrimination toward breastfeeding mothers, believe it or not. When I was in grad school and breastfeeding, I drove 1 hour and 45 minutes to class, pumped my car, went to class for two hours, and then pumped in my car again because the alternative was a public bathroom during a ten minute break where we had a quiz directly after the break so I couldn't be late. The first few times I tried to set up my pump and do a quick pump during that break, I came back to class with milk spilled all over my shirt and my sticky, dirty pump parts shoved in a plastic grocery bag, late for the damn quiz! Oh, and not to mention 19 and 20 year old women were coming in and out of the bathroom the whole time and staring at me and looking shocked and grossed out or asking me questions. It was awful. And my boobs hurt and I got mastitis. Damn, I am pissed at my university for putting me in such an awful situation.",

      "I freelance in the film industry soooooo you can imagine what it\u2019s like for us. I\u2019m so lucky I managed to pick up a job that finishes when I\u2019ll be 36 weeks, pure dumb luck that was. Otherwise you just have to quit, but also most people wouldn\u2019t hire you knowing you\u2019re pregnant and due in the middle of a show. I should also note we work 12 hour days. Either way the state of California does give you some money, you can claim disability up to 4 weeks before birth (you claim it after), and then you go on disability for 6 weeks, or 8 weeks if you have a c section. Then you can get 6 weeks parental leave on top of that. Your partner can also get 6 weeks parental leave. Honestly when i found out I was pregnant I didn\u2019t expect anything, so I\u2019m glad the state of California has more than I thought! I don\u2019t think other states are as lucky. I did also email my union to ask for a reduction in my dues, they agreed I can go on inactive status, but I\u2019m going to petition to them that they include some sort of official maternity support in the dues system. Sooooo many women in my industry don\u2019t have babies because it\u2019s so hard, we work super long hours etc. Honestly we are leaving the industry and moving countries (to my home country of NZ) because of it.",

I'm fortunate enough that my employer pays 10 weeks of it, but the last two weeks I'm taking for the full FMLA comes out of my benefit time. I'm having to use comp time, vacation, holiday, and personal business days to cover that time. My husband works the same job as me and is able to take this time off with me as well. I feel lucky with just that, but it's not really that much compared to most other places around the world.",

It\u2019s sad that the bar is so low. Thankfully my company has realized that we can all do our jobs just as well from home so we are WFH for good now so even after 6 weeks I won\u2019t have to send baby to daycare. My amazing mother is already making her arrangements to come stay with the baby while I work from home. My dad\u2019s parents did it with me so she wants to pay it forward with me.

My state allows a ratio of two teachers to 10 infants (we had 3 to 10, but at lunch breaks we went down 2 to 10). Between having experienced what that is like both as a staff member and for the babies, my job only paying 6 weeks maternity leave, and only offering a 20% tuition discount it was a very easy choice to leave. This was at a very good center as well. Of course, I'm terrified of how this will impact my career long term. We want two kids, so I'm trying to figure out if we should start trying again after first baby is a year old so that my time staying home is as short as possible, or if we should have a huge gap between babies so I can have solid chunks of years in my career."

This means we can not have our own leave but we have to split the leave allotted to one person which is ridiculous. I\u2019ve decided to take 8 weeks, 6 weeks paid and 2 weeks vacation time. My leave starts the day I go into labor. My female boss has already hinted that she believed this to be a lot of time considering I\u2019m working from home. She\u2019s a mother herself but the definition of a corporate renegade. Excuse me, but I\u2019m not her and my office job doesn\u2019t define me.

      "I feel this is one of the huge reasons a lot of working women become stay at home moms (this and the price of childcare). My mom had a great career in interior design, but decided to quit until my brother was almost one because she was probably only going to get three weeks of mat leave. Then because she was nervous about childcare for him, she just didn't want to go back. When we moved, she got a better paying job, and her work place offered in office childcare for a better price. When we moved again and she started working for an independent company, they had a daycare next door they worked with. The owner of the company was a wonderful woman who also owned the daycare. My sister was born around that time and my mom loved the job and people. Five years later, the woman got cancer and sold her company. The daycare went to her son and was operated differently. The people who bought her company changed everything, so when my brother was born, she quit. They didn't offer more than four weeks of mat leave, unless you saved paid time off. She just decided to quit and hasn't been able to get another job, because the industry is freaking wild. Piss the wrong person off and your career is over. We I was pregnant and working at a marketing firm, my boss was very pissy every time I needed to go to a doctor appointment during the day. Sometimes I couldn't get appointments after work. Plus I had to go to a specialist about thirty minutes away so most of the time my appointments had to be scheduled at the end of the day. I ended up quitting because the stress of my boss's attitude hurt me.... It's ridiculous..."

Baby boy kicks prob 100x an hour several hours out of the day and then just normal amounts in between those hours. Kid better be a damn soccer player. Also, why does it feel like I can feel his heart beating in my stomach?! 3. Accidentally figured out a tip for the peeing but it not all coming out bc bladder is squished issue... after first and second initial trickles, lightly touch or tickle the area above your crack/tailbone area. It somehow stimulates more pee to come out lol. 4. Growing 4 bra cup sizes & nipples almost doubling in size when I was already a size G to begin with. 5. Not being able to breathe when doing basically nothing. 6. No energy at all yet and with this Covid-19 crap the stress and struggles have been extra real... worried I\u2019ll not have anything I need for him or anything done in time constantly... And am one helluva emotional mess lol. Also can relate to prob 80-90% of the other symptoms y\u2019all already mentioned.... Just had to throw my two cents in too. But thanks for the laughs!

As you know, needing to pee becomes an urgent matter when your bladder is getting boxed by a person inside of you and thanks to Covid, there's no bathrooms anywhere that you can use. I made him drive a couple miles out of the way to a neighboring summer town that won't be seeing tourists anytime soon; I figured that I would see a spot for him to pull over in.

      "It looks great! Couple of things I wish someone told me when we had our first kid several years ago. Don't set the crib mattress at the highest height when you first put it together. Cribs are usually a pain to change the mattress height. Within 8 months that kid is going to be sitting up and able to pull themselves up onto their feet. They will be able to flop out of the crib at the highest mattress setting. Might as well have it on the lowest setting to begin with. But you already have it at the high setting so I guess no reason to change it now. Just remember when you need to lower it to just lower it to the lowest setting and don't lower it to the middle setting or you'll just end up going through the pain of lowering it again a few months later. Change pad. That \"security strap\" you will use for maybe a week before you realize it's useless and just annoying and in the way every time you need to change the kid. The kid won't even come close to being able to pop out of that thing until they're 7-8 months. And they never will be able to pop out if you don't leave them unattended on the changing pad, which you're not supposed to anyway. If it comes off easily, just take it off. If not, just cut it off.",

Penis being the anatomically correct terminology does not mean you\u2019re automatically sexualizing a child just because he used the term. would i personally not want my child around him because of this behavior? probably not, but that\u2019s bc I have a son and a daughter. it should be fairly easy to remove though, i know a few people in the comments have already given suggestions on products to use to help get rid of it but also try the \u201cawesome\u201d brand cleaner. that stuff worked wonders on removing stains from my car a few years back. all in all, i\u2019m sorry this happened at your baby shower. i hope your MIL takes note of this behavior though, because it definitely isn\u2019t normal in my opinion.",

      "i've been sexually active without birth control or contraceptives for a few years. i started taking folic acid supplements to improve hair growth and boom i was pregnant in less than a few weeks. i found out later its the main vitamin in prenatals so i just kind of jump started a lot of things i think",
      "For us, it took two cycles of IUI. Honestly, your first step is talking with your OBGYN. The general rule is that if you are under 35, they generally won't do anything until you've been actively trying for a year. If you are over 35, it is cut down to 6 months. If you are concerned, you would just start with some general testing to rule out certain issues. A blood test can tell your AMH level/ovarian reserves. Your partner can very easily do a sperm test. These are really easy places to start. Slightly more invasive testing can include an ultrasound and an HSG, which checks that your fallopian tubes aren't blocked. The HSG was really the only test that sucked. Once you get some testing, you might have a better idea of what your options actually are. For us, our infertility was unexplained as everything came back normal. If we were younger, they would have probably recommended to just keep trying, but because of our age, they recommended starting with IUI.",
      "I had surgery. We had 5 miscarriages and did a bunch of hormone rounds with the RE, but weren't candidates for ICSI or IUI (we conceived nearly every cycle we tried). IVF was given to us as an option but more of a \"you can roll more dice per cycle, versus just one roll\" as they'd hopefully retrieve multiple eggs and create multiple embryos to test, and we'd have some better chances of hope with a theoretically viable embryo. They didn't quite figure out what our cause of infertility was, but figured the miscarriages were largely due to \"bad\" genetics of each embryo. I did an HSG, everything was clear (I had a slightly bicornuate and tilted uterus but both tubes were clear). They did ultrasounds of my ovaries and said I had PCOS but no signs of endometriosis, although I had symptoms for it (later determined to be adenomyosis). They didn't really offer any solutions outside of \"just\" doing IVF and spending $40k per cycle. With lack of other options, we saved for a year, and decided to do IVF. My BMI hovers in the high 20s, and apparently my clinic caps it at 30. The multiple back to back pregnancies, stress from infertility, and whatever else, and my year followup I had gained 5 pounds. They told me I was no longer a candidate because I was now over their threshold and recommended bariatric surgery. I don't qualify, for multiple reasons, and it was just insanely bad advice. Desperate, I went to a plastic surgeon. I had a tire around my middle that was disproportionate to the rest of my body, and figured maybe it'd cut out the five pounds, but settling that hey, maybe at least Id fit into clothes better if nothing else. I had extra savings tied to IVF that I wasn't going to do, no longer trusted the RE (the only one in my area), and basically said, fuck it. The plastic surgeon so happened to have a daughter with PCOS. He was older, and on his second act - he started out as an oncology surgeon and retired into plastics after a career of seeing the heartache from removing breasts for cancer treatment and wanted to help people restore some of what they'd lost. He actually palpated my \"tire\" and told me he didn't think it was fat, but he'd get rid of it and scheduled me for a tummy tuck. Lo and behold, he removed TEN POUNDS of cysts. I got pregnant five weeks post-op with my oldest living child, who just celebrated her sixth birthday last week.",
      "It really depends on your cause for infertility - I would try to find this out first. In the beginning, I did basically everything I could to not do IVF. I took letrozole to make sure I was ovulating. I did IUI and weekly acupuncture. I was already really fit, but cut out sugar and gluten from my diet to control any inflammation. We spent thousands of dollars to try to get pregnant through other means. Turns out my tubes were completely blocked and the doctor could not guarantee a surgery would work. Ultimately, after two years of alternative methods, my husband and I decided to do IVF. I am now 28 weeks pregnant with our first child. If we went this route immediately or found out about my tubes earlier, we probably would have saved 15k in medical bills. I know IVF isn\u2019t for everyone, but it worked for us and we are so grateful. Whatever route you choose, you are stronger than you think! Infertility sucks but you are not alone.",

      "I am over 40, never tried to get pregnant and was on birth control pills for over 20 years. We could conceive but I had 2 MCs back to back. I decided to try to retrieve some eggs and try IVF (we get one free try paid by the Government). I figured I could always freeze my eggs first and see where it goes. The egg retrieval only yielded 2 mature eggs due to a giant cyst blocking one ovary, they fertilized but didn\u2019t make it during division. IUI didn\u2019t seem feasible since I was getting pregnant. Fertility doctor was concerned about the cyst and told me not to try until I saw a specialist. It took a couple of months to get the appointment, and they said the cyst can be removed later, it should not affect fertility. Month and a half later, I had one period that resulted in another pregnancy, 12w4d at the moment. As everyone said, you need to see what the problem is. Everyone is different and every fertility issue is devastating. Always be positive and look for another plan. The egg retrieval didn\u2019t yield any blasts, but these 2 eggs could have implanted and been another 2 MCs. Maybe the trigger shot matured some eggs faster. Who knows.

Last the Ferber method is only one option and its in my personal opinion not a good one, it feels cruel and the best advice I ever heard was you must follow your instincts. So if they are screaming and you are both crying it's not right for you. I for example plan to use the methods and examples in the book Sweet Sleep by la leche league. Either way to be honest I am not in a hurry to have my child leave the family bed, they will do so on their own. Congratulations on your pregnancy and best of luck with the move.

I\u2019d lay on the floor next to my son\u2019s crib on a dog bed (a good one!) and we\u2019d fall asleep together. He could see that I was there, we could say good night, sometimes he\u2019d want me to hold his hand as he fell asleep. We had a solid pre bedtime routine of rocking and a set number of books and a milk (when we did milk). Then we\u2019d lay him down and lay down next to him. It wasn\u2019t perfect and some nights it was a long process! But we went from laying there until he fell asleep to, laying him down and hanging out for a little bit and then checking on him, to laying him down and telling him we\u2019d check on him and he just falls asleep. There are other ways, and it\u2019s okay to pick a way that makes you feel good as a parent. If that\u2019s Ferber then Ferber, if it\u2019s not do whatever works for your family!",

Did he actually so those words or did you imply it from the context? As in, did he literally say the words \"You are being a bad parent\" to you? The reason I ask is I've been around a few people before with more sensitive personalities who tend to say \"X person said I was a Y\" when they didn't, they just said something that could maybe interpreted that way if you chose to take it the worst way it could have been interpreted. Same person would hand off a phone call and say \"I can't do it, this person is yelling at me\" and they were literally just asking her questions she couldn't handle or not immediately taking her word for everything and pushing for reasons or more detail. It sounds like the guy is a jerk, but OP, just checking on this.

A quick google search says you can clean the area thoroughly with hot soapy water, or use hot water and bleach, or a last resort a pesticide. Let the area dry fully before you put anything back. Make sure you throw the cloth out that you've cleaned them with as any live ones will multiply anywhere! I struggled with mold mites in an extremely damp house I rented for a year and it wasn't fun trying to combat them. Hope this helps a bit.",

Luckily we didn't have the litter/litter box in the kitchen otherwise everything in the pantry would've had to be tossed. What room is this in? Do you have anything in that room that could be considered a food source for mites? Cleaning wise, vacuum, dispose outside immediately, hot water bath vacuum components (rollers, canister, filter if it's a reusable one) and then try a steam cleaner, if you have a carpet/ rug nearby use a carpet cleaner. For surfaces, diluted bleach if the surface can handle it.",

Keeping the sink clear and the garbage managed are the two things I try to do even if I have no energy cause they will stink up my whole house in no time. Lastly I buy some good candles in actually natural scents and made with soy or beeswax and I\u2019ll light them if I\u2019m having company.

I also run a splash of vinegar down my garbage disposal weekly to keep it fresh and clean smelling. When it comes to laundry, I love using Zum detergent. I wash all the bedding, blankets, pillowcases, and curtains frequently to keep everything feeling fresh. Zum also has amazing cleaning concentrates, my favorite is the sea salt scent. I dilute it with water and add about 1/4 cup of rubbing alcohol to make a wonderful all-purpose cleaner. Additionally, I use hypochlorous acid in a spray bottle to disinfect and sanitize around my home. I especially spray wooden cutting boards, trash cans, dog beds, and any non-washable fabric surfaces.

Well, essential oils are chemical and synthetic, just as DIY sprays. Just being homemade or *\"essential\"* (as opposed to what ?) does not make them less chemical or synthetic. The only natural scent you could add to your home is fragrant flowers. However, that would be horribly expensive and time-consuming if you wanted to make your home constantly smelling from them.

If any of your local schools is doing a fundraiser, mattress sale fundraisers have been popping up near me in recent years. Same thing as with the Restore, it\u2019s overstock or weird fabric patterns, but they\u2019re new and good to go. You also might try reaching out to a local homeless shelter or food pantry for some ideas that suit your local community better. Good luck with this, you can get through this!",
      "Is the outer layer of the mattress some zippered cover you can remove? My elderly cat was sick on my mattress (springs though) and I ended up removing my cover that had a big label on it saying DO NOT REMOVE DO NOT WASH because I figured if I didn't take it off and try my luck I'd have to toss the mattress anyway. You may be more risk averse than that. Anyway got a launderette to deal with the outer layer and then fought bitterly to reassemble the mattress, miserable work but ended up with a nice clean mattress again. Second the recommendation for mattress toppers, they're just so nice. And treat yourself to nice sheets! Congrats on getting to the point where you feel you can deal with this, it's hard!",
      "I would spray the areas with Dawn powerwash or something similar, let it sit for a while with paper towels over it then remove them. Just so you can sort of peel off that initial layer without spreading it or pushing it in. Depending on how it looks afterwards, maybe do it again with baking soda or something similar. Possibly vacuum or scrub from there. Definitely get a mattress protector if you\u2019re keeping that one, just so you don\u2019t have to worry about this again. I purchased a memory foam mattress on Amazon for around $150 years ago, it was rolled up in the box. It was a great mattress. I agree you should prioritize a new one as sleep is very important to your health, even if you\u2019re lying in bed all the time lol.",
      "Can you treat yourself to a new mattress? Might be a nice way to start fresh.",
      "Hire an upholstery cleaner if you can afford it. See if a mate has one you can borrow, if you can't. Chuck a foam topper and/or mattress protector over the top once it's dry. Congrats on getting far enough out of the hole to ask this question!"

      "If it were me here\u2019s what I would do. First I would get my painters mask with cartridges rated for acid gasses. This is anecdotal, but when I had to clean up a rotting Halloween pumpkin that smelled really bad I put that on and I literally couldn\u2019t smell it at all, maybe it would help with this. Drag it outside, wear those thick long gloves for doing dishes and toss everything in a trash bag, then triple bag it and put it in my trash bin. Hose it out while it\u2019s on its side doing my best to get anything remaining down a drain. And I\u2019ve actually cleaned out a super stinky cooler before (from fish) and I misted the inside of it and smeared baking soda on everything, covering it as much as I could. Then a few days later I scraped it off and threw as much away as I could before rinsing it again. I think I did that three times total before the smell was completely gone, then I cleaned the inside with a scrubby sponge and dish soap, rinsed it all out, and it was as good as new. Good luck!",

Wash out Then get like a weed sprayer, fill with some vinegar and spray it a few times it a good deodorant. After wash again with some soap. Can take the lid off easily to dump it without it flopping around. But you just will not get it out fully. And probably not remotely truly good safe even after.

      "Last summer the power to our house got knocked out in the middle of summer (90+ degree heat). We were dumb and didn't clean our fridge or freezer out (I know we suck). There was meat, vegetables and other frozen foods in there for about 3-4 weeks. 1. Removed everything and do a cleaning, then do it again with bleach & water. Set it outside open 2. Stuff it with cardboard 3. Remove the cardboard and run it for a little bit 4. Turn it off and clean it again, stuff it with cardboard and some charcoal briquettes (we just put ours on newspaper) 5. We then bought a sachet that is used for getting dead animal smell out of houses (like when they die in walls, we ordered it off Amazon for about $15) 6. Put that in 7. For a week we did this, rotating carboard, the sachet and charcoal out and cleaning it daily. 8. Turn it on with cardboard in it again and let it run. After that week, there was still a slight smell but after running the fridge and freezer for a couple days it went away. We went through this headache because replacing it is expensive and we knew our landlord wouldn't replace it (please see above where we were out of power for 3-4 weeks due to a landlord not replacing our weatherhead). If you're die hard about not buying another one, you can try this. Results may vary-like I said ours was a fridge so might not work as well.",
      "My sister-in-law's deep freezer died when she had most of a 1/4 cow in it. It was the middle of summer and it was in her garage. By the time she got someone out to haul it away it was so bad she said the workers were gagging and coughing as they took it. Considering their job was waste removal I feel like that speaks volumes on how bad the smell was.",
      "Hi there, I'm a professional cleaner and have done all kinds of cleaning, including body decomp. You will never get the smell out. No amount of bleach, time, prayer, ozone machines, or nose blindness will ever restore it. The amount of time and chemical and pain it will cost you to clean that, compared to the cost of buying a new one indicates that this appliance is a total loss. To prevent this from happening in the future, there are devices that stop plugs from being removed accidentally. I'm sorry for you loss, of the meat and the freezer. Take it from a pro though, it ain't worth it. Just dump the thing and replace it. Edit: phrasing and grammar referring to plug. Edit 2: the redditor who said to turn it back on and freeze everything in it again to move it, is absolutely alpha brained, cleaning pilled, and logic coded. Edit 3: another person below stated to ratchet strap it shut, so I would say, skip the cleaning, refreeze everything, ratchet strap it shut, and get it out of there in one piece.",

Just physically say out loud, \u201cI\u2019m putting the trash in the bin.\u201d Or \u201cI\u2019m throwing these in the basket.\u201d That has helped me the most with just getting the small stuff out of the way.

My bed is like my mind. When I get out of bed I make my bed. Not perfect. But I straighten my sheets and then take any dirty laundry to my hamper. I use this like a gauge. When I am good, it's easy to do this every day. Its automatic. But when it becomes not automatic... Like when I get out of bed and forget (or ignore, or procrastinate) and just leave the room. When I come back later and see, I know it's time for some self-care. As long as I try to keep that in mind, and pay attention to the signs and implement the self care, I rebound. Its pulled me out of some spirals. Sometimes it doesn't work. Sometimes the laundry piles, and I breakdown and have a weep. But I try really hard to use the routine to keep myself from getting that far down the spiral.",

Things just pile up, and then become so daunting to even tackle. There was a point it was a good day if I even showered. I totally relate. Every roommate I had before getting a house hated they felt like they lived in a museum because I was so tidy and clean\u2026. Then BOOM out of no where life just gets you. I constantly feel like I live in a hoarders situation. I hate it. On the days I do pick up I tend to find I put things in the room they belong in, but not away. Then I just end up with the same situation, but essentially the items just moved throughout my house. I don\u2019t even know you, but opening yourself up and asking for help I commend you for. I feel like I wouldn\u2019t have the courage to \u201cexpose\u201d my living situation like you did. I don\u2019t even live in my house right now (in the garage\u2026 long story) and I spent 5 hours just picking up as I have people coming to my home tomorrow. I don\u2019t even have a lot of physical \u201cthings\u201d right now due to a fire related issue. I come home and drop whatever in the floor and it just piles on. I just took down candy cane Christmas yard lights this last weekend. Still have the lights up on the roof. I\u2019m always wondering what my neighbors are thinking. For the last 3.5 years I had a toilet sitting on my front porch and other miscellaneous things that definitely don\u2019t belong on a porch. Two days ago I finally decorated my front porch again with things I had in my backyard. I lost my dog in October \u2026 I was wondering the garden gnome section at At Home and found a \u201cgnome\u201d that looked EXACTLY like my dog- except for size lol. I bought it and put it on my porch. Been hard coming home to nothing (dog or human being). It\u2019s weird but I felt like I needed to give this \u201cgnome\u201d a \u201chome\u201d, so finally after years I have decorated my porch again. It\u2019s silly that a garden gnome brought me enough happiness to do this, but I\u2019m glad it did. Now makes me feel like I\u2019m a little more capable and it\u2019s even a nice way to come into my house now. Sorry my response is a lot about myself. Comforting knowing I\u2019m not alone and haven\u2019t had anyone to share this small \u201cachievement\u201d with other than my therapist. https://preview.redd.it/ukc0jezndztc1.jpeg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=92621f5e56636a8d99b0f8304cf992e2ef5d67a2 Nothing crazy, but glad I had things in my backyard to give the little gnome a home!",

Perhaps they are doing some digging or moving dirt around and the air is disturbed. Or maybe there's some trees around your place that are blooming? We had pine tree in front of our old house and if I had my windows open during the spring when it released bits pollen, our house would look like this and I would find a layer of pollen on every surface of the room.

Also my inbox is always open for venting or trauma dumping. When you go no contact, the guilt really tries to eat you up. But stand strong with your head up high. Alcoholism is a disease, only sometimes curable. There was absolutely nothing I could have done to convince my dad to stop drinking. When I would stop talking to him, I would feel SO BAD and he would guilt me back in. The way he lived his life though was not something I wanted for my future. I miss him every single day but I am glad he is no longer suffering. I said all that to say that when you do get \u201cthat call\u201d that something happened, it\u2019s gonna be okay. This isn\u2019t in your power to control. You can only control yourself. I saw myself slipping down into the addiction before my dad passed, just like my dad.

There is no cure for late stage skin cancer (chemo and radiation are not treatment options for this type of cancer) and he still gets new tumours all the time. The theory is that he had prolonged exposure to mercury. You did the right thing.",
      "Liquid mercury is so harmless that people used to take it by the tablespoon as a daily laxative, and there was really no acute or chronic toxicity from doing that. You're right that the vacuum cleaner was a bad idea, as it probably speeds up the the formation of toxic vapors. But a few drops is barely enough to register above the typical background concentrations. Not enough to worry about acute mercury poisoning. Probably on par with breaking one of those CFL light bulbs. Tossing the vacuum bag and airing out the room was a reasonable precaution. Calling the emergency services was probably overkill, but they wouldn't fault you for it either. They don't expect everyone to be an expert in exactly much exposure is dangerous and how much to ignore. The environmental safety people take every spill seriously, and follow similar cleanup protocols whether it's a broken thermometer or an industrial accident. Most likely they are obligated to do so by law, for a couple of reasons. One is to avoid giving anyone the wrong impression that it's always harmless just because they were told that one time that their spill wasn't big enough to worry about. The other is there would be more bureaucracy and red tape. That would slow down cleanups for the more serious spills. They'd have to quarantine areas longer, send out a hazard assessment team, collect and catalogue samples, wait for lab results, write reports, etc. before even getting started. It's better to just treat any reported spill seriously.",
      "Sadly this is a worst case scenario. The vacuum could have very easily arisoled the Mercury. First thing, Vaccum is done, anything the mercury touches is now toxic and needs to be thrown away. Next you now need to deal with the room that the vacuum was used in, and this is going to be a MUCH more difficult task determining what was contaminated and what isnt. On top of that them walking around is now exposing this material to everything. It is bad real bad, Im sorry :(.",
      "Idk if it was already asked/answered, but wtf did stepdad have a bottle of mercury from and isn\u2019t it illegal there to have it?",
      "1. Heat from the vacuum motor causes the mercury to evaporate rapidly. 2. The vacuum then aerosolizes the mercury, spreading toxic vapor and tiny droplets throughout the room and the vacuum itself. 3. The entire vacuum becomes contaminated, releasing mercury vapor every time it\u2019s used in the future. \u2e3b \u2620\ufe0f Why It\u2019s Dangerous: \u2022 Mercury vapor is invisible, odorless, and highly toxic when inhaled. \u2022 Just a few drops can raise indoor air mercury concentrations to hazardous levels, especially in small or poorly ventilated areas. \u2022 Exposure risks include: \u2022 Neurological damage \u2022 Respiratory issues \u2022 Kidney damage \u2022 Increased risk for children and pregnant individuals"

      "You may want to talk your BF into getting a mattress protector for many reasons. Firstly, to avoid problems like this. GBS sells good ones that aren't just plastic, and they work really well. Secondly, any stain whatsoever will void the warranty on a mattress. A person's son sat on the edge of his bed when playing video games, and it caused a dip at the end of the bed. It looked like a smashed sandwich it was so thin. The company was going to replace it, but since it had a stain on it, they refused. I also recommend getting an encasement and a protector. An encasement will keep out bedbugs, and it will keep your mattress clean until you take it off. The protector keeps the encasement clean so you don't have to take the encasement off to clean it was well. Lastly, these things will protect his investment. They are inexpensive compared to a $10k mattress, but will save him and you a lot of headache.",
      "Cleaning Solution There are several stain removers on the market, and many are designed to break down the proteins in blood. They often include oxygenated bleach and natural enzyme cleaners. In addition to store-bought solutions, you can make a cleaner with household materials. The following mixtures can be used to clean blood stains from your mattress safely. We\u2019ll go over how to clean with these mixtures in the next section. Soap and water: Add half a cup of mild dish soap or laundry detergent to 2 to 3 tablespoons of water. Mix these two ingredients until they form a foamy substance. Baking soda and water: Mix one part baking soda with two parts water until it forms a paste. White vinegar and water: Mix a half a cup of vinegar with a half a gallon of warm water. Cornstarch, salt, and hydrogen peroxide: Add half a cup of cornstarch with 1 tablespoon of table salt and a quarter cup of hydrogen peroxide. Combine this mixture until it forms a paste. (Please note: Hydrogen peroxide can damage foam mattresses sand should only be used on innerspring mattresses.)

      "I asked ChatGPT about the ingredients list and why it might be such an effective shower cleaning product: 1. Strong Surfactants (Degreasers & Detergents) Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES) & Cocamidopropyl Betaine: These are powerful surfactants that break down oils, grease, and grime. They are common in household cleaners as well. Sodium Chloride (Salt): Helps with scrubbing action and thickens the formula, which allows it to cling to surfaces for longer. 2. Solvents & pH Adjusters (Break Down Stubborn Residue) Citric Acid: A mild acid that helps dissolve mineral deposits, soap scum, and hard water stains. This is commonly found in bathroom cleaners. Tetrasodium EDTA: A chelating agent that binds to metal ions in hard water, preventing buildup and making it easier to rinse away residue.",

You\u2019re cleaning so much more than your home, in many ways you\u2019re cleaning your mind and your heart too. Adult you will be very glad, and very proud, of what you\u2019re undertaking here. Progress is progress and you probably won\u2019t live in this house forever but the skills you gain in this process will stay with you and be useful always. You\u2019re showing incredible strength and fortitude of self. I hope you\u2019re also able to enjoy the peace and meditative benefits of cleaning, and that it brings you some kind of solace. Proud of you!!!",
      "To add to the comments here about options, I\u2019d like to suggest this pathway as an option to consider: Step 1- find work(you have a solid work ethic and value for order, great traits in an employee) Step 2- Save money. Step 3- Find a therapist in your area Step 4- Sign up for financial assistance at your local community college Step 5- Explore housing options, share rent with roommates/rent with a friend/move in with a safer local family member or family friend can all be options to consider. It is possible to work part time while attending school. This might be the most important way for you to move forward, both working towards building your knowledge and credits in school while also being in a more healthy and sustainable environment. Therapy is also very important and can be necessary when coming from a complicated family situation like the one are in. Having mature support and guidance from someone capable and skilled to help you are important. Knowing that there are different ways to approach this situation can be useful, and giving yourself access to leave if at all possible can be beneficial for your mental health in the short term while working towards your goals.

Fill the bucket with a good squirt of dawn(into the water and a little into the water stream from the tap for a little bit of a lather) and the hottest water you can handle. A rule to remember: Hot water and soap cuts grease. It might take more than one bucket, but when you're finished, dry it off with a microfiber towel(or paper towel, whatever you have around. I wouldn't recommend a house towel or napkins/tissue as it will degrade and leave a fuzzy residue) If you have access to a store and a little money, you can get some Clean Freak lemon scent. Something about lemon fresh and clean really brings out the cleanly feeling that makes us all feel great and encourages us to keep going. You've already accomplished so much. I hope you continue on this journey of yours and remember how it felt to stand there basking in your own accomplishment. Never forget how it felt to sit down on a clean surface, with a doable list of daily and manageable sanitation tasks, and sigh that big sigh of relief knowing that you don't have to live in a mess anymore.

Dry thoroughly: After cleaning, always rinse the area with clean water and dry it with a soft cloth to prevent water spots and streaks. Good luck!!",

They also sell all their pants 36\" length hemmed, which is great for tall people like me. I have 12 pairs in this fit, ranging from selvedge to corduroy to canvas to twill and they're great. In terms of quality x price, and as a guy living in the bay area where hoodies rule year round, it's really hard to beat Champion Reverse Weave sweatshirts. You can get them for about $40-45 and they're about 95% as good as the absolute top of the market, and they acceptable as a \"style\" brand in the same way Chucks are. For outdoor outerwear, I generally recommend Fjallraven for people who don't live in very wet areas. They have a broad range of offerings and the cotton canvas they use is far better suited for most conditions than most fabrics. That said, I've had my Mountain Hardware Ghost Whisperer down puffer for ten years and it's indispensible. I'll *always* own a lightweight down puffer, and this one is great. For technical tees (and I realize this is getting a bit niche and specific), Under Armour's jacquard knit (they call it \"seamless\") is also a tremendous value. They're slim fit, which is great for taller folks like me, and frequently available in the $20-25 range. I prefer these over all my more expensive athletic tees no matter the price, and they make them in a bazillion colors.

Your best bet is either picking out a couple you like from different stores and then wait for them to be discounted, go to a furniture outlet store, or search a second-hand one (for example by finding an older model of a brand you like and then looking specifically for that model on facebook marketplace or a similar site).

The vendors will vary wildly. We have a couple things from them and are quite pleased with them, but we also took our time choosing them and in the end, we don't expect them to be BIFL, but we needed someone who would deliver to a small island and they did! We had few expectations from our couch, we just wanted something long enough to be able to lie down for a nap on and it's been shockingly great. We also have a massive metal bedframe, just plain, but thick, with extra supports in the middle and tall enough to run a vacuum under.

It\u2019s hollow in the middle which has doubled for us as a storage space and does let airflow get under the mattress since we have it pulled a few inches away from the wall. It does have some cosmetic damage now since it\u2019s pine (I think) and gets dinged pretty easily, and I had to strengthen the hinges on the large drawers because they were pretty flimsy. We use all the drawers and cubbies daily, and they still work great. The only times I\u2019ve stubbed my toe is when I leave the drawers slightly open.

They also happen to make every day shorts and pants that are basically the same as the ones used in the sport but with pockets.

I remove their little logo patch and while I only wear the pants in casual situations no one really notices they're basically BJJ pants. The sizing follows the conventions for the sporting equipment. If you follow their size chart (it goes by height and weight and will give you a size that looks something like \"A5\") you will very reliably get the correct size for you, the design of the clothing for that sport gives it a lot of ability to fit different bodies well. No cargo pockets, but you do get two pockets on the front and one on your butt at back right. Also, in my opinion, cargo shorts are only acceptable wear if you're trying to look ok during the brief periods where they're trendy.

      "What model do you have? TomTom GPS devices have a pretty shitty lockout and are extremely easy to hack/pirate maps for. My Dad refuses to buy a new GPS and still uses a TomTom XL IQ Routers Edition model. This model has hit end-of-life and cannot be updated officially, but I just put the latest maps on it (from aprox. December 6, 2018). Everything you need to know is here: www.gpsurl.com 1. Plug in your GPS to your computer, ignore any autoplay stuff from Windows or TomTom software. Take a full backup of the device (manually copy/paste the entire contents of drive). 2. Download [FastActivate](https://www.gpsurl.com/tomtom-open-tools-and-tweaks/183754-fastactivate-post-1-includes-updater.html). Copy the executable to the root of your device and run it. Select \"My Device Info\" (I think option 7) and wait for Notepad to pop open. There will be a line that says software or navcore version, it will be four numerical digits (most likely 9xxx). This is your navcore version. Also take note what map(s) are listed. Close FastActivate. 3. Check to see what map(s) are compatible with your device/navcore combination [here](https://www.gpsurl.com/tomtom-maps/244778-compatible-chart-v1020-maps.html). If your navcore is extremely outdated, proceed to step 4, if your navcore will support the latest maps, proceed to step 5. 4. THIS IS ONLY NECESSARY IF YOUR NAVCORE IS TOO OLD TO SUPPORT NEWER MAPS: Install/Update the official software from TomTom (TomTom Home 2) and fully update the internal software (navcore) of the device. TT Home will bitch about the device being EoL but it will still let you update the system software and update QuickGPSFix (although pointless, you'll see). 5. Download the map(s) you want from [here](https://www.gpsurl.com/tomtom-maps-with-meta-codes/). Make sure you get a version that's compatible with your device/navcore combo (as checked in step 3. Maps are labeled as LOCATION_XXXX_YYYY with XXXX being the map's version number and YYYY being the revision). 6. Delete the old/existing map(s) folder(s) from your device. The name of the folder was shown in step 2. 7. Extract and copy the map(s) folder that you downloaded in step 5 to the root of the GPS device. This may take some time and it's best to walk away from the PC. TomTom devices have horribly slow and sometimes unreliable transfer rates. I had to unplug and retry copying over the map I wanted three times until it finally worked. 8. Once everything is copied over, open up FastActivate again. This time choose options 1 through 4 (Update Meta, Patch Maps..., Patch Navcore..., Patch TT Home), waiting for each step to complete before continuing to the next. Then choose option 6 (Update QuickGPSFix). Once finished you can close out FastActivate and disconnect your device. Congrats, you just pirated a TomTom map! You can also download voices, car icons, change the boot screen, battery low screen, ect. FastActivate will need to be used to activate voices and icons, some will just plain old refuse to work. My Dad uses John Cleese as his voice of choice. Reply here if you have issues, I'll try and help out.",

On one hand, photos of an old knife that isn't able to be purchased new gets a ton of upvotes. It's very easy to for someone casually interested in BIFL stuff to see that on their main feed, upvote a cool photo with a backstory that fits in the title, and continue scrolling. On the other hand, posts that allow people to buy or help people to learn about BIFL stuff are also important. Knowing something is well-made and still available for purchase, or reviews on such items bring excellent information that we all benefit from since they help us find and continue using well-made gear. Unfortunately, the nature of Reddit is that these types of high-quality posts tend not to get nearly as much attention from users because they're higher effort to digest, so the pictures of \"vintage\" finds tend to drown them out in Reddit's \"hotness\" algorithm that determines a post's visibility. We've banned posts about things that aren't able to be currently bought new before. And it resulted in a similarly-angry post to this one, except it complained that the subreddit had been inundated by photos of wool socks, cast iron, and thermoses because there wasn't much in the way of _unique_ content.

Something I couldn't do in that car and not lose half the night adding water. My dad wanted to go for a car ride that night and was mad that my mom let me use the good car. I told him if my car was good enough he could drive it. He foolishly accepted this. When I got home that night after running around he threw the keys at me and rudley told me I could get a different car."

The spot operator asked how long he had been with Willie (because everyone else had played with him for decades), and his response was \"well, the crash was in '77, so almost 24 years\". The crash he was referring to was the one that killed Ronnie Van Zant of Lynyrd Skynyrd, who he had worked for before that. Guitar world was next to the rail, and afterwards his guitar was sitting on a table right in front of me for about 5 minutes and I just sat there and studied it.

It died after less than 2 years and was deemed unrepairable by even the most experienced repairman due to it being impossible to open without destroying the outer casing, and the broken part was such a catastrophic failure, it would've cost more than the fridge was worth to buy a new part and fix it. They researched fridges for months to find the most reliable one possible and it still died faster than a neglected goldfish. They didn't have the extended warranty either...",

      "My grandmother has the same model in a beautiful teal color. She received it as a gift from my grandfather for their 30th wedding anniversary. She has made many delicious meals using that over the years. It's brings tears to my eyes thinking about the times we shared using that mixer. Just recently she baked me a cake for my birthday. It looked so delicious, my mouth was watering as I went to take my first bite. I imagined savoring the flavor of this delicious, warm, moist treat as it entered my cavity. I looked at her, and she smiled, as I could tell she was fully enjoying the moment of her conquest. I slowly walked over to her, readying myself for the big embrace as I felt my eyes swelling up. Finally as I embraced her, I watched my hand barreling wildly toward her face, followed by her falling swiftly to the ground. A large thud was heard round the house. She used betty crocker in my cake mix! Can you believe that bitch? You make my cakes from scratch grandma. Had to put her in a home. Thanks kitchen aid. Now who's gonna cook for my family?",

Was devastated, tore house and car apart to no avail. Then, one random ass day, I was walking to my car to go get my haircut, and looked down. Between a seam of my sidewalk, there it laid. For years it had been laying on the ground right outside my front door and was still in perfectly good condition. A couple years later, I lost it again. Same story, tore everything up trying to find. It was gone for a couple years. Then one day, I was packing to move, and came across an old pair of shorts at the back of my closet I never wore anymore. I grabbed them and went to fold them, as I did the knife fell out of the pocket. I broke down because I was packing to move into the house I inherited very shortly after my mother passed away. Felt like full circle. I recently, and I mean as of last week, had lost it again. Thought I left it on a buddy\u2019s boat after having cut a line.

Was only missing about a week this time, forgot I had emptied my pockets in my truck in the door as I played golf. In a compartment I hadn\u2019t used before. Was very very relieved. I still carry it. I probably ought to buy a new one and carry it instead of risking losing a keepsake, but it\u2019s not the same. I use it everyday, minus the lost time.

Until this polyurethane foam thing that had some sort of significant role in it's function deteriorated to such degree that something came in contact with something else and the thing just popped like every cap there was and the battery leaked. Yeah it made it like near 40 years... My point is that you should check old electronics for possible deterioration for stuff like that. I'm confident that the clock would still be ticking at half a century of age if the foam wouldn't have deteriorated. The thing is that... My grandma has a mechanical alarm clock of my great grandma from like end of 1800s. It's perfectly functional and I doubt it'll ever stop working on the account of every component it has being absurdly redudant in size due to limitations of fabrication methods for the time.

A great example of this is vintage double-edge safety razors. The general consensus among aficionados is that some of the best razors money can buy are vintage ones from the era before disposables and multi-blade cartridges. The Gillette Fatboy line in particular is used as a benchmark against which all other adjustable razors are measured - even those manufactured today which cost hundreds of dollars. I found mine (actually a gold-plated [Executive model](http://www.gilletteadjustable.com/executive-fatboy.html)) at a thrift shop for $20. As a consumer, I appreciate knowing that I have a good chance of finding an item at a flea market that performs this well, such as a used razor made in the 50s that completely out-classes 99% of everything made today which *costs more*, at a flea market or thrift store for $20.

      "There is a fine line. Without talking about the history of some brands and what is reputable, you are losing out of a ton of info. For example, I would not have known to keep an eye out for old Craftman tools in my dad's collection to save one day, or to pick them up from a garage sale if I saw one. And from the same discussion you learn that you should not buy newer Craftsman tools. Same goes for picking up old, but perfectly acceptable pyrex bowls, measuring cups, etc from the thrift store, or not throwing them out when your grandma passes away. I bought an '80s KitchenAid food processor from a thrift shop for $30 with tons of attachments after I had seen some raving about how that model has survived the test of time and hard use. Now, we don't need to see your grandfather's bowie knife from the war. We do not need to see your pots and pans that have rust stains on them (unless you refinished an ancient cast iron pan and wish to show us.) And we have no interest in seeing old things that still work, but have next to no use in modern society, like your Gameboy. Instead of a thousand posts that shouldn't be in BIFL, maybe we can do brand or item spotlights. Like \"Share your car with 400k+ miles on it and tell us its story.\" In this situation, we could all still learn that some years of this or that model are superb and will likely go on forever, so if you are in the market for a used car you know what to look for.",

How long will the product last? I agree some posts on here of a 50's whatsit are not always useful but its the only form of time travel we posess. keep it a long time and then expost facto go hey this lasted a long time. pretty bifl. the only other way is to do an aVe style where someone \"tears\" a product apart literally and goes ok these bits skoocum its going to chooch for a good long time or this is garbage. toss it in the heap. what other way do you DETERMINE if something is bifl? the $8 screw driver I got from lowes crosses me as BIFL its micro usb rechargeable. this means I will never have to worry about a charger and while not DESIGNED to be taken apart it \"CAN\" be taken apart and it uses a standardized 14400 cell inside which CAN be sourced and replaced. ie how \"serviceable\" a product is, is one of my primary \"bifl\" criteria.

It had plenty of issues, like the first 2 gears would slip and I'd just stop moving when I needed to merge into faster traffic from a stop. The battery was somehow always being discharged way too quickly, so if I didn't drive it for more than 24-48 hours it would be dead. Handling was like driving a boat, but it sure was comfy. On the plus side everything on it worked, the engine itself never really had issues, and the interior was nice and comfy. Plus chrome rims, and driving a car as a 19 year old with Merc logos felt pretty awesome...even if the car was only worth 3000 dollars. Sound system was great, and plenty of room for friends.

      "I really like the fit of Taylor Stitch \"Democratic Jeans\" fit. It's neither loose nor tight and fits well around me 23\" calves. They also sell all their pants 36\" length hemmed, which is great for tall people like me. I have 12 pairs in this fit, ranging from selvedge to corduroy to canvas to twill and they're great. In terms of quality x price, and as a guy living in the bay area where hoodies rule year round, it's really hard to beat Champion Reverse Weave sweatshirts. You can get them for about $40-45 and they're about 95% as good as the absolute top of the market, and they acceptable as a \"style\" brand in the same way Chucks are. For outdoor outerwear, I generally recommend Fjallraven for people who don't live in very wet areas. They have a broad range of offerings and the cotton canvas they use is far better suited for most conditions than most fabrics. That said, I've had my Mountain Hardware Ghost Whisperer down puffer for ten years and it's indispensible. I'll *always* own a lightweight down puffer, and this one is great. For technical tees (and I realize this is getting a bit niche and specific), Under Armour's jacquard knit (they call it \"seamless\") is also a tremendous value. They're slim fit, which is great for taller folks like me, and frequently available in the $20-25 range. I prefer these over all my more expensive athletic tees no matter the price, and they make them in a bazillion colors. For boxer briefs, while they don't last very long with regular wear (maybe 1-2 years), Mack Weldon AirknitX are exceptionally comfortable. Too expensive, but ok on sale.",

      "This company primarily makes apparel that you wear to jiujitsu classes. That means it has to be durable enough for another person to grab it and use it to lift you into the air, or otherwise severely abuse the fabric, regularly, and when it is potentially soaking wet (from sweat). They also happen to make every day shorts and pants that are basically the same as the ones used in the sport but with pockets. They have a crotch gusset just like the ones for the sport, and do not impede your motion in any way as that would ruin the utility of such pants in a sport like that. https://www.kingz.com/products/kingz-casual-gi-shorts They're 55 bucks. I got one pair of the pants that was probably mislabeled at the factory and their customer support asked me to send a couple pictures to confirm and then refunded me for them within a couple hours of me getting them, so the support is also good and reliable. I remove their little logo patch and while I only wear the pants in casual situations no one really notices they're basically BJJ pants. The sizing follows the conventions for the sporting equipment. If you follow their size chart (it goes by height and weight and will give you a size that looks something like \"A5\") you will very reliably get the correct size for you, the design of the clothing for that sport gives it a lot of ability to fit different bodies well. No cargo pockets, but you do get two pockets on the front and one on your butt at back right. Also, in my opinion, cargo shorts are only acceptable wear if you're trying to look ok during the brief periods where they're trendy. When they're not trendy they go to the forbidden zone of fashion almost instantly. I won't buy them, personally.

I don't have local or network TV, but I have most of the topics I need, courtesy of Roku and YouTube. The funny thing is, I now have GREAT internet via Wave (now Astound). No lags, ever -- and I live just outside the Tahoe National Forest. Before (with Comcast), I lived in a dense, urban downtown area. And internet and cable was constantly down. I have SO MUCH to watch on Roku and with the channels I do subscribe to, the internet is great and reliable. The only time it's down, is if my area has a complete power outage. Usually forest fires or heat waves. The monthly cost is now $144. Down from $275 some 5 years ago -- who knows what those Comcast pirates charge now. I don't miss all that network TV at all. I do miss having a digital DVR. Might have to upgrade for that.",

Netflix, hbo, prime, paramount, Apple TV\u2026..we just pick one to have activated for a month and then cancel or pause that and go on to the next one the next month\u2026except we do Netflix about every other month, since that\u2019s the most popular one in our household. Easy to just adjust/alter the rotation to cater to what you/your family watch the most\u2026.what\u2019s coming out that month\u2026.etc. We don\u2019t even miss having them all at once. In fact it makes choosing what to watch much easier. There is PLENTY to watch on any 1-3 services at a time\u2026.. without having to pay for having *all* of them every single month. Feel like a lot of people are paying through the teeth to absolutely spoil themselves with choices."

Avoid any with a \u201cwave and open\u201d sensor as that will eventually stop working. If you have pets, especially persistent large dogs or crazy smart cats, or small children it\u2019s also worth it to get one with a simple locking mechanism. But just remember sometimes frugal isn\u2019t necessarily \u201ccheap\u201d. I\u2019d rather spend money on a decent trash can that easy to clean and lasts me a long time than a super cheap one that I have to replace each year.

That ended my idea of having at least that large of a trash bin in the house. I don't have to worry about bugs or odors inside anymore. If something is too big for the under the sink bin, I walk it 20 feet and dump it directly into the garage garbage can."

Run those same numbers for whatever potential new job offer you have and I\u2019m guessing you\u2019d end up well ahead by getting a job closer to you or moving closer to your job.

      "There are a lot of costs for driving besides gas. At 70 cents for mileage(AAA and IRS rates), with your commute time worth the same as your hourly wage you can do the math on this. Right now you make $260 gross, after subtracting $63 for mileage and dividing by 9.5 hours it's $20.7 an hour. So a work from home job that pays $21 an hour would net a little more. A job with half the commute would need to pay $26.60 to match your $32.50 You could also factor in mileage at a lower rate if you drive a cheaper car than average, or a lower hourly rate for your commute time. At 50 cents a mile and $15 an hour for commuting you subtract $67.5, divided by 8 hours is $24.06 an hour. Then you can do the same math for another job with a shorter commute and compare.",

      "Yes, many things. My husband and sometimes myself do little side hustles where we clean out estates. He works with Tate Real estate now that we moved here but we did similar things before we moved. TONS of cleaning supplies, kitchen ware, linens and blankets, house hold goods etc\u2026we just did one. Few weeks ago where we got all that I just mentioned. Tools, used lawn mowers and lawn equipment. What we don\u2019t use ( we have five acres and do very light home steading) we are putting into his cavernous workshop to fix and/or resell it at flea markets. It\u2019s more his hobby than mine.

We visited with her a lot , especially after her husband passed. That was 8 years ago. I haven\u2019t bought foil, plastic baggies, paper plates, few other things since then. We still have smithy foil for prob 10 more years. Oh we paid for it, but it was cheap. She had 2 of the huge commercial rolls too, just opened the second one. Cost us $12 for all of it She had neat stuff. Issue of Ebony when MLK was killed, in pristine condition. Another original magazine from when JFK was assassinated. Lots of pricey items. I had to painstakingly look this stuff up and figure out how to price it. I bought some much sought after old Xmas ornaments too. We brought in about $40K, we got a % and then we paid for our items. She had 5 antique sewing machines that worked perfectly! She was a seamstress long ago. I bought one, the one worth the least, just as an ode to her. It sits on a dresser, it is beautiful. She had the most beautiful furniture ever, all solid burl wood. Estate sales are where you find stuff back when it was built to last!",

One box had an original bottle of DDT!!!), PVC, drip supplies, gloves, plant supports, markers, shade cloth, weed barrier, composters, and yard art. Often you can get house plants or cuttings. I also buy the entire contents of the top desk drawer. The postage stamps that are included often offset the cost. Any hobbies that require specialized tools: we\u2019ve purchased tool boxes containing all the tools necessary for cake decorating, leatherwork (including shoe making), quilting, woodgraining, oil painting, specialized pasta, fly tying, scrapbooking, mosaic, yarn/needle/sewing crafts, jewelry making, beer making, canning, and more. Keep in mind that we had no experience with any of these crafts previously. But for a modest price, we gave them a whirl and enjoyed many of them. Most sales had the accompanying \u201chow to\u201d books and specialized journals available. Also, we could walk away with old towels, sheets, diabetic syringes, and pet supplies to donate to our favorite animal rescue. Shovels, rakes, hoses, and wheel barrows went to either the botanical gardens or the horse rescue. All in all, we cruise estate sales and redistribute to scouts, seniors, schools, or whatever charities hit our radar.",

Instead I get a half full tub for $2 and consider myself lucky. I pick up any laundry or cleaning product that looks useful, usually for a dollar or two. During last weekend\u2019s estate sale trip I got a brand new in package ironing board for $2.50 and a giant Costco pack of white tissue paper for $1. At another store I found a pack of 20 quality coat hangers and the sale runner waved her hand and told me to take them for free. Everyone else is looking for Gucci and Chanel.

This includes art for the walls, furniture and small kitchen appliances, dishes, etc. I've also managed to find better quality clothing that fits me at some estate sales for a fraction of their cost ($5 dollar fashion brand cashmere coat, for example). Sometimes, I'll find unexpired and unopened food we'd use for super prices... tools or duct tape, screws, nails... things I need to repair stuff around our home, etc. Last weekend I found a bunch of free books to read at one because it was the last day, they were hindered by their wi-fi not working and so were only doing cash/Venmo. I found a Clive Barker book.. and a copy of The Necronomicon.. for free. I also found *a gallon* container of Urine/Odor eliminator that I use... for $1.. and it was actually 50 cents because it was their half-off day.

      "North Carolina third-culture ~~kid~~ Adult checking in. My other culture is British. Here's what I've got to offer you: - Your air conditioning only has one temperature: on. The thermostat turns it to off when it reaches the desired temperature. Lowering the thermostat does not make your spaces colder, faster. But it does offer the opportunity to forget to change your thermostat to a reasonable temperature until too late, thus wasting money. Just set your thermostat to the reasonable temperature and exercise patience, or aim a fan at yourself, while you wait. - Your local area will have some weather condition or other that they cannot drive in. Where I live, as soon as it starts raining, people set themselves on fire (or at least all the fire trucks deploy). When it starts snowing, people start driving as if it is a slalom course and they need to avoid hitting the snow flakes. Whatever it is, when that thing happens, get off the road. Accident avoidance is cheaper than accident survival. - Our Indian food is not your Indian food. If you can find a dosa, you'll be paying a premium for it. - Walmart is equivalent to ASDA. Kroger (or one of their subsidiary brands) is equivalent to Tesco. You already know Aldi and Lidl, but as a point of culture, you can leave the hand basket on the belt without having to unload it. - Digestives are \"graham crackers\", \"teddy grahams\", or \"animal crackers\" and come in a slightly different shape and texture. You can get proper digestives but you'll be paying a premium. - Farmer's markets are not green grocers. Farm stands are green grocers. Farmer's markets are expensive. - We don't have slow-boat mail. It is first class or nothing. This can be expensive to ship things overseas EXCEPT if you get the flat rate paperboard envelopes marked up by the USPS to be flat rate. As much as you can cram in there where it still closes with its own adhesive will ship for under $25. And you can stuff a fair amount in. Most post offices don't have this in their supplies area, you have to order it from online USPS. - Gas/petrol may be less expensive here but do still practice good fuel hygiene. Tint your windows so your car doesn't get as hot in the summer thus reducing or eliminating your air conditioner idling to turn your car into any sort of temperature people feel safe entering. Crack your windows whenever safe to help vent hot air. I even have these bug screens I can put over my car's doors which allows me to leave the car parked with the windows fully down and come back to a cool car with no new buggy residents; obviously only in a safe area. - Spray/treat your yard for mosquitoes. The treatment is cheaper than the medical bills from a mosquito-transmitted illness. - If you drink beer, there are two places in the US which have water equivalent in beer-making properties to London for a porter: the mountains of North Carolina and Colorado. Those are going to taste the most like porters from home. You can always ask a bar tender for a sample of anything on tap. - Any major metro area will have some version of \"The London Bridge Pub\" with slight variations to the name. They'll have all of your favorites, at an extreme markup. Time for new favorites. Cheaper favorites. - Weetabix and other goodies are available from time to time in our grocery stores depending on what is happening in trade relations with Canada. Shredded Wheat isn't Weetabix so don't waste your money. (You can obviously tell my favorite breakfast cereal.) - Our cheese, tomatoes, and bread are subpar. I'm sorry. Our water cress is still banging, tho. (I'm surely not the only one who enjoys a cheese, tomato, and water cress sandwich.) - We do indeed have PG Tips, though expensively and not widely sold. American bagged tea is made for turning into sweet tea, it is not the same as a cuppa. Loose tea is Chinese or Japanese. - Public schooling here is private schooling of the UK. You needn't pay for a private school unless your child has special circumstances which cannot be attended to in a public school. And before the haters @ me, \"special circumstances\" is not me saying anything negative, it can be a child who learns best in a forest school or someone who needs a school that has a serious and fantastic lacrosse program because you're looking at a lacrosse scholarship for college or any number of things. - If your exterior walls of your house aren't insulated, insulate them. It will more than pay for itself. Same with insulating the attic as well as adding vent fans to the attic.",
      "I'm a Brit living in North Carolina. Everyone uses their dryer here - it's really rare to see any laundry hung on the line. Medical care is expensive. WIth my kids it's always been a \"how sick are you\" type conversation before I schedule an appointment. Urgent cares are more expensive than your \"regular\" doctor so get established quickly with a regular doc. If you order take-away - find the menu on the actual store website - don't order through doordash or Uber eats - it's typically marked up a little on those sites. Door Dash is really common in the USA (but will add up quickly if you door dash a lot of food!) People will tell you that Costco / Big Box stores are great value but you might actually spend more money in there than if you didn't have a membership! I know you have Costco in the UK anyway so you're familiar with that. If your house has duel zone AC units - this will save you a bit of money. I have an upstairs temp and a downstairs temp. I keep upstairs at 74 during the day and put it down to 71 for sleeping. I keep downstairs at 74 typically and don't really touch it. Postage back to England is SOOO expensive. Avoid using the post office for this. There are better services around. (Moonpig is a great website for sending a card/gift directly to someone in England right from your computer/phone!) Good luck!",
      "You're gonna want AC in Hotlanta, but most places you move to will already have it, so saving money means using a setback thermostat to economize, and window AC units where possible. Is it cheaper to let the house warm up during the day or do you keep it cool all day? It depends on how much the house leaks air. If the house is leaky, old, drafty, it's much cheaper to shut off your AC when you leave. If your house is sealed and insulated like a picnic cooler, it doesn't cost much to leave it cold all day. As with heat, smaller areas are cheaper to cool. Window units can cool one room while you let the others go hot. Especially for sleeping. Many landlords and HOAs don't allow window units. Portable units generally suck. Whatever your AC arrangements, if you have a quiet room fan blowing directly on you then 78 on the thermostat feels like 74. This is once your AC has DRIED the air. Then fans are really effective. If your sweat doesn't evaporate you get heat stroke. Stay hydrated, my friend. Put lots of sugar in your tea and none in your grits. Don't mention blood pudding.",
      "First, happy Juneteenth. Us and UK Building systems can be very different, so I would get to know your house is vital systems far before you ever make your first phone call to a technician. Look at the type of plumbing, heating and air conditioning, wall systems, electrical, Etc and take a good pulse of your whole home. READ YOUR INSURANCE POLICY. Check what is and isn't covered. There's a trend in insurance dropping coverage due to drone footage of the property showing damage. Sometimes fire or flooding isn't included but is a whole separate insurance. There's a lawyer named Mike who practices in Georgia and talks extensively about this on YouTube. Look him up. You can and should check the license of the plumber/electrician/general contractor you use as well as making sure they are bonded and insured. The trades are necessary but residential small work can be expensive because they are losing the opportunity to get bigger jobs. Workers can run away with your deposit and homeowners can get overwhelmed with decisions when a pipe bursts, so having some DIY or at least knowledge can avoid the 'tuition fee' of an emergency call. When you get any major job done on your house, always get 3 quotes. Plumbing: galvanized, copper, PEX, mix of them? How old? If Pex, type Air B? Pex plumbing is learnable for homeowners. The electric expansion tool is something I bought used and keep. HVAC: what kind of hot water heater do you have, and what maintenance is required? Tank water heaters require regular flushes that are often not performed and so do tankless. What year is your condenser, and how do you keep the grate clean? Have you changed your air filter/s in the last month? If not, time to check on them Wall systems: older homes (1940s is when it changes) could have lathe and plaster vs drywall. Drywall up to 1980s (not 70s, that's just when the laws changed) could contain asbestos, so before cutting into it get a test. Labs sell kits on Amazon and give results online. Insulation: if it's small rocks it's vermiculite and probably contains asbestos any asbestos work and you should look at the Libby foundation, since there is funding for remediation. The spot where the chimney meets the house always leaks first, and you are in hurricane \ud83c\udf00 country. Locate your attic access and crawl space access. Electric \u26a1 up to 1950s could be knob and tube Cloth clad wire is a fire hazard, but if it's insulated directly with plastic coating it's considered acceptable if you leave it alone Federal Pacific, Zinsco, and especially STAB-LOC electric panels are recalled and a huge fire hazard. Prices for repairs have shot up 200%+ since pre pandemic, commiserate with supply chain problems and skill loss. There's a pretty good way to ROI with insulation but I wouldn't bother until around maybe October - air seal. Finally again, it's Juneteenth, so tell someone happy Juneteenth and tip heavily. Your community members need support.",
      "Set the thermostat and don't touch it. Shop around for auto insurance. Do this pretty much at towards the end of your policy term. There is ZERO benefit to being loyal to a company. Find a \"FARMER'S MARKET.\" They go by different names and are sometimes Asian or Latino owned. These are brick-and-mortar stores, not pop-up parking lot stands.

      "Meal PREP, not meal PLAN. You can cook, do so. So plan out things you can make as a whole regular recipe but are easily used for leftovers. Soup is one of the most nutritious, flexible, forgiving, easy, and tasty foods out there. It can be as simple as some frozen veggies, a couple of cans of beans, some vegetable broth, etc. to give you lunches for a week. There are also good silicone molds to freeze portions of soup for later if you don't want the exact same lunch all week. We make a lot of sheet pan meals. We love the pizza one. Beans, onions, and zucchini roasted as the bottom later, then add some sauce, cheese, and whatever toppings you like and it's a healthy version of a pizza. These are also very flexible and can easily make a Mediterranean version, Mexican version, etc. For produce, enjoy it right after you go shopping, but make sure to work through it in the first few days. Salads, fresh fruit, etc. are all great even if you can't buy enough to last until your next trip. If you like fruit every day, I like canned fruit packed in JUST fruit juice (no fake or added sugar of any type). I keep the cans in the fridge and enjoy them when I'm wanting fruit but don't have anything fresh on hand. Keep track of what goes bad. Is it going bad before it's even cooked or is cooked food going bad? Is it always produce? As you see what tends to sit too long, you can adjust how much you're buying. We've found that one of the common issues is buying food for three recipes but not getting to them all in the week like expected and some things end up going bad.",
      "Hey, welcome to solo grocery life. It\u2019s a learning curve but totally doable. Here are some tips that saved my budget and my sanity: Buy frozen veggies and fruit. They\u2019re just as nutritious, last forever, and you can use exactly what you need without anything going bad. Huge win. Fresh produce? Stick to stuff that lasts. Carrots, cabbage, potatoes, onions, garlic, and apples are MVPs. They\u2019ll chill in your fridge for weeks. Canned and dry goods are your besties. Beans, lentils, chickpeas, rice, pasta, oats. Cheap, filling, and won\u2019t betray you with mold. Learn the art of freezing leftovers. Made too much soup? Freeze single portions. Cooked rice or pasta? Freeze it. Bread? Always freeze the extra. Meal plan with flexibility. You don\u2019t need to be rigid, just sketch out three to four meal ideas per week using overlapping ingredients so you don\u2019t waste half a zucchini. Prep things when you get home. If you chop veggies and store them well, like carrots in water, you\u2019re more likely to use them before they rot in the drawer of shame. Buy staples in bulk, but not perishables. Oats, rice, flour, spices, and similar foods are great to buy in bulk because they don\u2019t spoil quickly. Skip bulk spinach unless you're Popeye. Cook once, eat twice or more. Make big meals and rotate them with different sides or toppings. Tired of chili? Turn it into nachos, tacos, or a burrito bowl. Also, store brands are your best friend and Aldi\u2019s canned and jarred goods are excellent for the price. You got this.",
      "Canned chickpeas are amazing and versatile if you don\u2019t feel comfortable making them from dry ones. Otherwise, rice stores well. Frozen fruits and veggies are incredible and last a long time. But meal planning/prepping will definitely be your best friend. Shop sales and in season produce if you\u2019d like fresh produce! You can also pre-cook and freeze meals!",
      "Your freezer will be your friend; treat it like a pantry dedicated to frozen food. You can buy bigger portions of things, separate into individual containers/bags, and freeze. Of course, you can do this as well for shelf-stable foods, if needed. You can break up packages of things like Mac & Cheese (powder kind, not cheese sauce kind) and save half of the uncooked box for next time. I do this often with Kraft Mac or Pasta-Roni. Also, frozen fruits and veggies will be your friend, for meals that don't *require* fresh produce. Lastly, be intentional with your choices... Buy things that can do double- or triple-duty in meals so you don't waste as much. Buy a bag of potatoes, for example... Baked potato, mashed potatoes, potato wedges, potato soup. One purchase, multiple meals!",
      "Meal plan and do a prep day. I'm not single and I have kids, so it's not exactly the same, but I'm super cheap and I hate grocery shopping, so it's close. My day was is Sunday. In the winter I do soup Sunday where I make a new stock and a couple different soups / stews / chilis which are freezer friendly. I eat these soups for lunches and quick dinners year round. In the summer, I do preserves and baking on Sunday's. I make sure that all fresh foods are prepped and frozen ready to be used and all leftovers are either incorporated into a new dish for the week or frozen in a way that it can be easily reheated into a meal. I only shopped on Tuesdays."

      "As a vegetarian, I get it! When produce is about to go bad it\u2019s time for a stir fry, chili, soup, casserole, etc. something where you can throw all your remaining ingredients in, even if not much, maybe add a few new ones and boom- food. Also, throwing any leftover veggies into a pasta with pesto or olive oil or butter or whatever red sauce works."

Less than 2 months later, shortages hit and it could not be found in stores. It lasted 2 full years even after sharing with a few people who couldn't find any. When the last roll was used, I purchased another package which is now stashed.

Should I trade in my old phone or consider selling it online? Prices start at $77 for the 64GB SE 2rd Gen (unlocked) - but as you have no selling history, it may take a while to move. Just list it as the cheapest, with plenty of photos, etc and someone will take the risk. Swappa takes a cut, and then there is shipping. So your net would be closer to $50.

      "Repair tech here, I get asked this a lot. The most important thing to consider is software support. Our entire lives are stored on our phones, and having an old phone that doesn't receive security updates is not worth it. You could get hacked due to security vulnerabilities, compatibility issues with apps after a certain time, and a lot more. The iPhone SE 2nd generation, released in April 2020, is expected to receive support for approximately 5 to 7 years from its release date. Based on this, the last update will likely be in 2025, with a potential end-of-support date ranging from 2026 to 2027. Even after the end of software support, Apple may provide security updates and patches for a few more years, but only for extremely dangerous vulterabilities. I would recommend switching to the iPhone SE 3rd generation which you can get for around $200 or less refurbished or used. The 3rd generation should last until 2029-2030. Alternatively, if you want to put more life into your 2nd generation, you could try to replace the battery yourself. I've done thousands of these, and it's one of the more doable repairs for a normal person. There are tons of guides online that can help you do that, and rather than buying a battery from Amazon or something, I'd suggest buying the battery from a repair shop. Don't pay more than $30 for the battery, and if the price is below $15 then you're getting an aftermarket battery which can be fine in most cases. You will need a heat gun/hair dryer, a precision screwdriver with pentalobe, triwing, and phillips bits, and maybe some 99% isopropyl alcohol.",

Lastly, we ended up with 3 stuffed bags of banana peels that I will be using in my raised garden beds we are building next week. No waste here!! When all was said and done I made it through about 70 bananas. All in all, everything I made yesterday came out to about $22. The biggest purchase was butter, bananas, and flour. I\u2019ve never done anything like this so again, thank you all for the advice and hopefully those of you who think this was a bad financial purchase rethink it when we got about 100+ servings of food for $22. Hope you all find some good deals near you soon, and make something amazing. Good luck, and thank you for following me on my banana journey! &#x200B; edit: posting here the recipes i used for my rolls and banana bread :) [banana rolls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O3cBHUxKik) [banana bread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ob8eL4mMOys) (youtube links) the banana bread came out perfectly, it was just like the recipe and delicious! i added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips per loaf in half of the batches. as for the rolls, they didn't come out perfectly imo, they taste great but are a bit..lumpy! and not as golden brown, but they are still awesome and taste just like a roll! it's so weird how the banana taste just almost goes away! i suggest you try either recipe, the bread is more of a crowd pleaser and the rolls are a bit more experimental :) have fun! &#x200B; edit 2: answering 2 questions i saw asked a couple times: i am going to give away half of the mini loaves to friends and neighbors, 2 of the large loaves are going to my mother in law this weekend, and later today i will call the homeless shelter/food bank near me and see if they accept homecooked food. if they do, they will be getting some loaves as well! i'm very happy to be sharing the love with others and i've already had a friend stop by my house for some haha! slightly more in depth cost breakdown: bananas: $6, butter: $9, flour: $3, brown sugar: $3, eggs: $4, small bag of chocolate chips: $2. i forgot eggs in my calculations, so it ends up being about $27 for everything :) i am super super happy with that and learned a lot throughout this process. thanks for coming along for the ride! Link to dehydrated bananas and choco bananas I just took: [more banana](https://imgur.com/a/pmn2zmk) &#x200B; &#x200B; \\~tldr\\~ total time spent: 6-7 hours total cost: \\~$27 dollars (ymmv depending where you live) the haul: 6 large loaves, 16 mini loaves, 48 banana rolls, 12 whole frozen, 12 sliced frozen, 6 chocolate covered bananas, 4 dehydrated bananas, 10ish left to eat plain, and 3 large bags of peels to make compost for my raised beds.",

Do this. Then spoon it out and mash it super good, really good. My mother who is 85 makes great banana bread but she never ripened them in the oven. I had shown her that and now that is her go to way. Really brings out the banana flavor, caramelizes the banana's sugars. Honestly, I read this post earlier and it made me hungry so I went to the store and bought bananas. lol. Eat it warm with butter. Yum!

      "Tile work is amazingly cheap if you can do it yourself, and amazingly pricey to pay others. The reality is that tile work is actually pretty simple, and with spacers and proper mortar, a simple youtube DIY guide on how to trowel it under the tile properly, and really anyone can do this. The problem is that tile work is a \"finished\" product, so if you have never done it before there is a serious anxiety about screwing up. The good thing is that even id you do screw up, it's actually pretty easy to chip tiles off, more than you think, especially if it's before you grout. But, in terms of self-confidence? It's pretty easy to NOT mess up as well because it's just really not that hard. The BIGGEST thing is making sure you line things up properly. Also, things don't need to be perfect. That is what silicon color matching caulk is for at the edges instead of the grout... Great work. It looks fantastic. Be careful, you might just get the bug for tiling things and start eyeing that bathroom reno you've been wanting to do :D",
      "First off... I'm proud of you! It looks wonderful! Second... some advice. I own and operate a tile grout restoration company. I don't do new installs, just maintenance. My entire niche business exists because almost all tile guys use a water based sealer that lasts for 6 months or so. When the sealer breaks down, the staining and damage begins. Out of the tons of sealer options you see at Lowes or Home Depot, only one is a solvent based sealer. Miracle 511 Impregnator. Other solvent based sealers can be found online, but locally at big box stores that is the only correct choice. The lifespan difference is insane. Up to a decade of protection from this stuff. I personally reapply every two years or so myself on my own tile, but it's overkill to do so. If you take water and rub it a bit on the grout and it darkens/changes color at all, it's absorbing the water and it needs to be sealed. Sealed grout will wipe clean of damn near everything and never be a pain to clean. Every issue of staining, crumbling, leaking... it's *always* due to a sealer breaking down or never being used in the first place. Grout is like a concrete sponge, and the sealer encapsulates the matter. So congrats again, what a great looking job. If you seal it with a solvent base, you'll never need to pay someone like me to come repair it. For any other DIY'ers out there who have stained grout, Harbor Freight sells a cheap steamer that will get many stains out and its also incredibly good for all hard surfaces (oven, fridge, microwave, toilet, tiny crevices in sinks, etc).",
      "Tile looks tight! Looks great, really. Did you have to get the extra long screws for the outlet covers afterwards or were you smarter than me and prepared for it (lol)? I just tiled our kitchen, too, with probably as little prior experience as you. Definitely fun picking out tile and grout, imagining what it\u2019s going to look like for the next 10-15 years or so! I was told to make sure to do a good job on mixing the grout so you don\u2019t get the bubbles, but it\u2019s been up for about three months now and no problems. Now to tile a bathroom!! Best of luck in all your home improvement efforts!!",
      "I\u2019m no builder, but do a lot of stuff myself. Electrical stuff, like switches, light, outlets. Wood, like benches, stairs, closets. Painting. Tiles. I\u2019ve build a while kitchen. As long as it doesn\u2019t require too precise or specialist work. I have saved tens of thousands that way, and I enjoy doing it. Happy to see others can do this as well.",
      "Work as a project manager for a commercial flooring company that does roughly 4 million a year. I can tell you by having been in the estimating shoes of many projects that subcontractors (used by most flooring/tile setting companies in the northeast) expect a boat load of money for something that would take them a single day to lay and an hour to grout. With that being said: Back splashes are the worst! It is the most scrutinized part of the residential industry because it\u2019s always some kind of design or different shaped tile (obviously yours wasn\u2019t in this case). It is at eye height. Constantly looked at by the person cooking in the home. Always has the most call backs, and in general has the longest wait time on materials. When I ask a sub contractor how much they want to do a backsplash the majority of the time they don\u2019t even ask me how big it is. They ask how long it will take. If I say over a day 9 times out of 10 then say 1500 in labor. In the northeast. Your pricing is most likely right on point. I\u2019m glad you did this yourself. And I\u2019m glad you are happy with it. I wish more people would listen to me as estimator when I say \u201cthis is going to be expensive\u201d and \u201chonestly something like this isn\u2019t that hard to learn to do for yourself.\u201d Congrats.

So we found these closet mirrors for $4 and originally got 4 of them to test the Idea. G.f. didn't think it would work! We also had to also buy some of the Saw tooth hangers to put on them as they didn't come with hardware installed. The wood is pretty soft so it wasn't hard to get the on. We installed each hanger about 2-3 inches from each side with the little nails they come with and lined the (now middle) mirror up with a tad lower than head level for myself. Spaced them 1.25\" apart and we LOVED it! We loved it so much we went out and got the top 2 mirrors to add on to everything with the same process. total cost: $24 (mirrors) + $3 (hardware) = $27 mirror wall! possible future add-on/tip: place a 3rd hanger in the middle of each mirror, because there is an ever so small dip in the middle that you cant really see from the pictures",

      "Amazon isn't the only company that does this. It's common even for some grocery stores to inflate full prices on sale items. I spend a lot of time on deals, as we are on a tight budget. So my non-professional \"broke mom\" advice would be: - Never pay more for an item than you are willing to. Period. Want an Echo Dot? Decide how much you are willing to pay for one (reasonably) and wait until your opportunity comes up. - For Amazon, use camelcamelcamel. Don't always expect you can get the lowest price ever offered, but know the average price of the item over its sale history. - For Amazon, put the item in your cart and let it sit before a promotion. Make a note of it's prices before the promotion, then compare the promotion price the day of. - For non Amazon and some Amazon purchases, look at the average price other competitors are offering the product. - Search SlickDeals, FatWallet, and other deal sites. There could be a current deal on your item, but even if there isn't, you can see what deals there have been and if a specific company is popping up regularly with good deals on it. - Set up deal alerts for the item(s) your looking for on deal sites. If a deal matches your alert, they'll let you know of the opportunity. - Don't buy something that seems like a great deal just because it is a great deal. It's easy to get sucked into buying things you don't really need because it's XX% off. - For larger purchases, be patient! Research the price, set your deal alerts, check regularly on retailer promotions. But wait for your deal to come up. - For some non Amazon purchases, check RetailMeNot to make sure your retailer doesn't have a promotional code that could save you money. - Sign up to cash back sites like Swagbucks, Ebates, etc. Sign up to all of the major reputable ones. One might be offering 1% for the retailer you're about to purchase from, but another might have 5% at that time. They cost you nothing and you get money back from something you'd buy anyway. - For those who say they can't afford Prime, just want to make sure you know they do monthly for $10/mo now. You pay more total for the year, but for those like me $10/mo is within my budget and I save more than that every month on the things I order that I would be buying anyway. Just ultimately remember that all the info is out there to help you get a good value for your money, and a little patience goes a long way in saving.",
      "I noticed this last year when I was in the market for a portable Bluetooth speaker. Amazon always has ridiculous MSRPs on such speakers - like, $159 - but routinely sells them at or around $29.99. They'd take $5 off that price and call it a \"MASSIVE 84% PRIME DAY DISCOUNT!\" when it was actually a modest 17% discount on the \"every day\" price. My GF and I did pretty well this year. We got a $175 TV for $124.99, and also got modest discounts on some other things we actually needed. What I don't get about Amazon is how their shipping works. I ordered an Android TV box on Prime Day (not a discount, I just thought I'd do one order). The box ended up being a piece of junk, so I did a return, then ordered a more expensive one. I opted to pay $3.99 extra for one day shipping. But then I realized that I'd used a gift card to pay for the original box, and that hadn't been refunded yet. So I canceled the order for the new box and waited about 12 hours for Amazon to issue the credit. Once they did I went back and ordered the new Android TV box again... but this time it was *free* one day shipping! What gives, guys?",
      "Ya'll need those extensions that help you track price history. I always see if it's currently the cheapest price across multiple sites and if it's been cheaper in the past. Then I have extensions to notify me if it drops in price anytime soon. Invisible Hand, Keepa, Honey, Price Zombie plus ReviewMeta are helpful for Amazon shopping. Don't need all of them or you get like 3 banners to close sometimes but check them out and see what helps you best.",
      "I read in the Washington Post that Amazon is the greatest, smartest, and best company in the world.",
      "Haha if you bought something and didn't price check you're obviously not frugal. Always price check. There were good deals, I'm sure. You just can't blame Amazon for your impulsiveness. Every store ever is not there to be your friend. Be thrifty my friends."

      "I'm 61% sure this has been going on all over Amazon, and not just on Prime Day. On a serious note, couldn't issues like this be solved with some kind of law on profits? I've always thought it was crazy that places such as McDonald's can make 1000% profit on soda, and the like. What if it was illegal to make over 200% profit? I think that's more than fair. If it costs you 10$ to make something, you can't make more than 20$ on it. So you can't sell it for more than 30$. That's more than fair but capitalism isn't about being fair, right? **Edit: If you're going to reply and tell me I'm wrong, do yourself a favor and explain HOW or else you're just wasting everyone's time. Simply saying \"That's bad.\" does not a good argument make. I'm open to conflicting opinions, but they have to actually seem like some real logic and reasoning went into them.**",

Prime Day has always been a total sham non-event.

      "# Leave Reddit -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I urge anyone to leave Reddit immediately. Over the years Reddit has shown a clear and pervasive lack of respect for its own users, its third party developers, other cultures, the truth, and common decency. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ## Lack of respect for its own users The entire source of value for Reddit is twofold: 1. Its users link content created elsewhere, effectively siphoning value from other sources via its users. 2. Its users create new content specifically for it, thus profiting of off the free labour and content made by its users This means that Reddit creates no value but exploits its users to generate the value that uses to sell advertisements, charge its users for meaningless tokens, sell NFTs, and seek private investment. Reddit relies on volunteer moderation by people who receive no benefit, not thanks, and definitely no pay. Reddit is profiting entirely off all of its users doing all of the work from gathering links, to making comments, to moderating everything, all for free. Reddit is also going to sell your information, you data, your content to third party AI companies so that they can train their models on your work, your life, your content and Reddit can make money from it, all while you see nothing in return. ## Lack of respect for its third party developers I'm sure everyone at this point is familiar with the API changes putting many third party application developers out of business. Reddit saw how much money entities like OpenAI and other data scraping firms are making and wants a slice of that pie, and doesn't care who it tramples on in the process. Third party developers have created tools that make the use of Reddit far more appealing and feasible for so many people, again freely creating value for the company, and it doesn't care that it's killing off these initiatives in order to take some of the profits it thinks it's entitled to. ## Lack of respect for other cultures Reddit spreads and enforces right wing, libertarian, US values, morals, and ethics, forcing other cultures to abandon their own values and adopt American ones if they wish to provide free labour and content to a for profit American corporation. American cultural hegemony is ever present and only made worse by companies like Reddit actively forcing their values and social mores upon foreign cultures without any sensitivity or care for local values and customs. Meanwhile they allow reprehensible ideologies to spread through their network unchecked because, while other nations might make such hate and bigotry illegal, Reddit holds \"Free Speech\" in the highest regard, but only so long as it doesn't offend their own American sensibilities. ## Lack for respect for the truth Reddit has long been associated with disinformation, conspiracy theories, astroturfing, and many such targeted attacks against the truth. Again protected under a veil of \"Free Speech\", these harmful lies spread far and wide using Reddit as a base. Reddit allows whole deranged communities and power-mad moderators to enforce their own twisted world-views, allowing them to silence dissenting voices who oppose the radical, and often bigoted, vitriol spewed by those who fear leaving their own bubbles of conformity and isolation. ## Lack of respect for common decency Reddit is full of hate and bigotry. Many subreddits contain casual exclusion, discrimination, insults, homophobia, transphobia, racism, anti-semitism, colonialism, imperialism, American exceptionalism, and just general edgy hatred. Reddit is toxic, it creates, incentivises, and profits off of \"engagement\" and \"high arousal emotions\" which is a polite way of saying \"shouting matches\" and \"fear and hatred\". -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If not for ideological reasons then at least leave Reddit for personal ones. Do You enjoy endlessly scrolling Reddit? Does constantly refreshing your feed bring you any joy or pleasure? Does getting into meaningless internet arguments with strangers on the internet improve your life? Quit Reddit, if only for a few weeks, and see if it improves your life. I am leaving Reddit for good. I urge you to do so as well.",

      "I'm really tired of seeing articles like these from self-made people. Buying a new car is certainly always the most expensive option, but people exaggerate and make it sound like it's the major factor that stands between riches and ruin for most people. (To be clear, I'm talking about buying a new car ever, at all - not people who buy a new car every 2-3 years. Buying a new car often is clearly a terrible and costly decision - but to me, that's different than talking about buying a new car ever.) &#x200B; Let's say that you have a working career for 30 years, and during that time, you buy exactly three new cars. You drive each of them for 10 years. You pay $25K for each car and at the end of their life, you sell each car for $7K. So you're paying $18K for a vehicle, every 10 years. $1,800 a year goes toward your vehicle purchases. &#x200B; So let's hold everything else constant, and say you instead decide to buy a 3-year old vehicle. Let's say you do save a whole 33% off the purchase price. So you spend $16,667 on each vehicle. And let's say at the end of its life, you're still able to sell it for $7K, every time, even though it's three years older than the first example. So you're paying $9,667 for a vehicle, every 10 years. You're spending $967.70 a year - saving $832.30 every year over the course of your life. &#x200B; Don't get me wrong, I'd rather not spend an additional $832.30 a year if I don't need to. But there are a lot of decisions in life that would save the equivalent amount of money. Deciding to downsize the family vacation would easily have as much, or more, of an impact. Deciding to take a lunch to work would make a way bigger impact (if you could save $20 on your weekly lunch budget a week, you'd save $1,040 every year). Deciding to take a job that gives you a $2K raise a year would have more of an impact. &#x200B; The more you analyze buying a new vehicle over a used one, the more it looks like any other purchase in your life, whether it's rent, entertainment, travel, dining out - run the numbers, decide what you can afford and decide what's worth it to you, and then do what fits within your budget. The difference between a new car and a used in the above examples is like worrying about whether you make $40K a year and your neighbor makes $41,500 a year. Is that small of a difference really what is keeping you from being financially successful? Or is it the accumulation of a lot of factors?",
      "Counter-point: As someone who is into cars, buying new ensures that you know everything that has been done to a vehicle, both good and bad. I recently bought a new Ford Fiesta ST for $19K out the door, and used version with only 15k-20k miles were only going for maybe $1500 less then new. By buying new, I can ensure that some 20-year-old bro didn\u2019t thrash on the car or skip out on maintenance, plus Ford gives you a free 2-day pass to the Octane racing academy in Utah. I fully understand that being a car enthusiast is cost-prohibitive, but my expenses outside of cars are minimal, and I have about 6 months\u2019 worth of income saved up in a savings account. To me, cars are more then just a means of getting from point A to B, so I am at peace with (responsibly) spending money on this hobby of mine.",
      "A guy I worked with had two years left on his payments. Got into a fender bender (the fix for the damage was like 200-300 dollars). And he decided to just trade it in and buy a brand new one. (same make and model just new). And he was like it's a smart deal because his payments are only ten dollars more a month. He didn't understand that he was two years from owning his car, now he is five years, and 600 dollars from owning. This was like 7 years ago. And it still aggrivates the shit out of me that he didn't see how stupid that was.",
      "I make decent money but I always buy used on Craigslist. Don\u2019t get bottom of the barrel and always take your time to buy from a stand up person who just replaced their car. Been driving for 14 years, (16-30). Owned two cars. It\u2019s definitely the best way to go.",
      "When I was growing up in a poor neighborhood in Chicago, I always dreamed of being able to purchase a brand new car. I remember being 9 years old watching nice cars drive in the neighborhood and wishing that one day I would be able to get one myself. Once I graduated college and got a decent job, I was finally able to purchase one. I knew that it was a terrible financial decision but since it was always a dream of mine, I bought a $40,000 car and just last week it hit 100,000 miles. I would definitely never do it again, but 9 year old me would be proud."

      "The trick to buying a new car is to keep it maintained, plan on keeping it for 8-10+ years, and avoid accidents by driving carefully. If you take out a reasonable loan, and keep saving that payment once it's paid off, you will be able to have a sizable emergency fund for repairs or the next car. On top of that, as the sole owner, you are 100% in control of that car's history. No surprises of finding out this car was a rental that was abused 6 ways from sunday. This self made millionaire should check himself. There are bigger financial mistakes you can make.",
      "For normal people i agree; it is the most stupid thing. However, the single worst financial decision, if you are financially stable or even rich will be to buy a recreational boat, those things are insane expensive, you have to pay for the port, maintainance is extremely high, the value goes down as hell and you will never use it. If you want to make a real stupid decision, buy a boat or a small yatch",
      "This guy is absolutely wrong on this. Buying a new car is far from the worst financial decision millennials will make. Spending a shit ton of money on college and dropping out before getting a degree is up there with maxing out a credit card and paying the minimum monthly payment and taking out multiple payday loans to rent tires.",

I also watch for grouped streaming plans on sale. Usually I wind up with commercials but I don't care since it's so much cheaper with commercials and I'm a pro at ignoring them. My husband's business card offers $20 per month reimbursement on media including streaming services so I use that card with sales to maximize savings. Phone plans sometimes have grouped streaming services cheaper. If you need Microsoft software, family office plans are nice. You can split it with others for a reduced cost.

      "The most frugal option would be a DIY battery replacement. ifixit will sell you the battery for $25+shipping, but for an extra $5 they will include the tools and other needed parts. As [HonestRepairSTL](https://www.reddit.com/user/HonestRepairSTL/) says it's doable, just watch a load of videos and guides before trying. I've not done an SE 2020 yet, but have done several prior iPhone batteries and screens. Just take you time. \\>> 2. Buy a new iPhone. Any recommendations for new iPhone that is within a few hundred dollars but can handle basic needs? Don't buy new. Let someone else take the depreciation hit, and pickup one released 2+ years back. I earn good money and I have an SE 2020 on Mint for $15 a month. Why? Because I like not having debt. \\>> 4. Is it better to buy online such as Amazon, go to an Apple or Carrier store? I had no issues buying my families iPhones from sellers through swappa. Prices start at $129 for the 64GB SE 3rd Gen (unlocked) - they do list the battery health, so check that. \\>> 5. Should I trade in my old phone or consider selling it online? Prices start at $77 for the 64GB SE 2rd Gen (unlocked) - but as you have no selling history, it may take a while to move. Just list it as the cheapest, with plenty of photos, etc and someone will take the risk. Swappa takes a cut, and then there is shipping. So your net would be closer to $50.

      "Repair tech here, I get asked this a lot. The most important thing to consider is software support. Our entire lives are stored on our phones, and having an old phone that doesn't receive security updates is not worth it. You could get hacked due to security vulnerabilities, compatibility issues with apps after a certain time, and a lot more. The iPhone SE 2nd generation, released in April 2020, is expected to receive support for approximately 5 to 7 years from its release date. Based on this, the last update will likely be in 2025, with a potential end-of-support date ranging from 2026 to 2027. Even after the end of software support, Apple may provide security updates and patches for a few more years, but only for extremely dangerous vulterabilities. I would recommend switching to the iPhone SE 3rd generation which you can get for around $200 or less refurbished or used. The 3rd generation should last until 2029-2030. Alternatively, if you want to put more life into your 2nd generation, you could try to replace the battery yourself. I've done thousands of these, and it's one of the more doable repairs for a normal person. There are tons of guides online that can help you do that, and rather than buying a battery from Amazon or something, I'd suggest buying the battery from a repair shop. Don't pay more than $30 for the battery, and if the price is below $15 then you're getting an aftermarket battery which can be fine in most cases. You will need a heat gun/hair dryer, a precision screwdriver with pentalobe, triwing, and phillips bits, and maybe some 99% isopropyl alcohol.",

      "Meal PREP, not meal PLAN. You can cook, do so. So plan out things you can make as a whole regular recipe but are easily used for leftovers. Soup is one of the most nutritious, flexible, forgiving, easy, and tasty foods out there. It can be as simple as some frozen veggies, a couple of cans of beans, some vegetable broth, etc. to give you lunches for a week. There are also good silicone molds to freeze portions of soup for later if you don't want the exact same lunch all week. We make a lot of sheet pan meals. We love the pizza one. Beans, onions, and zucchini roasted as the bottom later, then add some sauce, cheese, and whatever toppings you like and it's a healthy version of a pizza. These are also very flexible and can easily make a Mediterranean version, Mexican version, etc. For produce, enjoy it right after you go shopping, but make sure to work through it in the first few days. Salads, fresh fruit, etc. are all great even if you can't buy enough to last until your next trip. If you like fruit every day, I like canned fruit packed in JUST fruit juice (no fake or added sugar of any type). I keep the cans in the fridge and enjoy them when I'm wanting fruit but don't have anything fresh on hand. Keep track of what goes bad. Is it going bad before it's even cooked or is cooked food going bad? Is it always produce? As you see what tends to sit too long, you can adjust how much you're buying. We've found that one of the common issues is buying food for three recipes but not getting to them all in the week like expected and some things end up going bad.",
      "Hey, welcome to solo grocery life. It\u2019s a learning curve but totally doable. Here are some tips that saved my budget and my sanity: Buy frozen veggies and fruit. They\u2019re just as nutritious, last forever, and you can use exactly what you need without anything going bad. Huge win. Fresh produce? Stick to stuff that lasts. Carrots, cabbage, potatoes, onions, garlic, and apples are MVPs. They\u2019ll chill in your fridge for weeks. Canned and dry goods are your besties. Beans, lentils, chickpeas, rice, pasta, oats. Cheap, filling, and won\u2019t betray you with mold. Learn the art of freezing leftovers. Made too much soup? Freeze single portions. Cooked rice or pasta? Freeze it. Bread? Always freeze the extra. Meal plan with flexibility. You don\u2019t need to be rigid, just sketch out three to four meal ideas per week using overlapping ingredients so you don\u2019t waste half a zucchini. Prep things when you get home. If you chop veggies and store them well, like carrots in water, you\u2019re more likely to use them before they rot in the drawer of shame. Buy staples in bulk, but not perishables. Oats, rice, flour, spices, and similar foods are great to buy in bulk because they don\u2019t spoil quickly. Skip bulk spinach unless you're Popeye. Cook once, eat twice or more. Make big meals and rotate them with different sides or toppings. Tired of chili? Turn it into nachos, tacos, or a burrito bowl. Also, store brands are your best friend and Aldi\u2019s canned and jarred goods are excellent for the price. You got this.",
      "Canned chickpeas are amazing and versatile if you don\u2019t feel comfortable making them from dry ones. Otherwise, rice stores well. Frozen fruits and veggies are incredible and last a long time. But meal planning/prepping will definitely be your best friend. Shop sales and in season produce if you\u2019d like fresh produce! You can also pre-cook and freeze meals!",
      "Your freezer will be your friend; treat it like a pantry dedicated to frozen food. You can buy bigger portions of things, separate into individual containers/bags, and freeze. Of course, you can do this as well for shelf-stable foods, if needed. You can break up packages of things like Mac & Cheese (powder kind, not cheese sauce kind) and save half of the uncooked box for next time. I do this often with Kraft Mac or Pasta-Roni. Also, frozen fruits and veggies will be your friend, for meals that don't *require* fresh produce. Lastly, be intentional with your choices... Buy things that can do double- or triple-duty in meals so you don't waste as much. Buy a bag of potatoes, for example... Baked potato, mashed potatoes, potato wedges, potato soup. One purchase, multiple meals!",
      "Meal plan and do a prep day. I'm not single and I have kids, so it's not exactly the same, but I'm super cheap and I hate grocery shopping, so it's close. My day was is Sunday. In the winter I do soup Sunday where I make a new stock and a couple different soups / stews / chilis which are freezer friendly. I eat these soups for lunches and quick dinners year round. In the summer, I do preserves and baking on Sunday's. I make sure that all fresh foods are prepped and frozen ready to be used and all leftovers are either incorporated into a new dish for the week or frozen in a way that it can be easily reheated into a meal. I only shopped on Tuesdays."

When produce is about to go bad it\u2019s time for a stir fry, chili, soup, casserole, etc. something where you can throw all your remaining ingredients in, even if not much, maybe add a few new ones and boom- food.

      "North Carolina third-culture ~~kid~~ Adult checking in. My other culture is British. Here's what I've got to offer you: - Your air conditioning only has one temperature: on. The thermostat turns it to off when it reaches the desired temperature. Lowering the thermostat does not make your spaces colder, faster. But it does offer the opportunity to forget to change your thermostat to a reasonable temperature until too late, thus wasting money. Just set your thermostat to the reasonable temperature and exercise patience, or aim a fan at yourself, while you wait. - Your local area will have some weather condition or other that they cannot drive in. Where I live, as soon as it starts raining, people set themselves on fire (or at least all the fire trucks deploy). When it starts snowing, people start driving as if it is a slalom course and they need to avoid hitting the snow flakes. Whatever it is, when that thing happens, get off the road. Accident avoidance is cheaper than accident survival. - Our Indian food is not your Indian food. If you can find a dosa, you'll be paying a premium for it. - Walmart is equivalent to ASDA. Kroger (or one of their subsidiary brands) is equivalent to Tesco. You already know Aldi and Lidl, but as a point of culture, you can leave the hand basket on the belt without having to unload it. - Digestives are \"graham crackers\", \"teddy grahams\", or \"animal crackers\" and come in a slightly different shape and texture. You can get proper digestives but you'll be paying a premium. - Farmer's markets are not green grocers. Farm stands are green grocers. Farmer's markets are expensive. - We don't have slow-boat mail. It is first class or nothing. This can be expensive to ship things overseas EXCEPT if you get the flat rate paperboard envelopes marked up by the USPS to be flat rate. As much as you can cram in there where it still closes with its own adhesive will ship for under $25. And you can stuff a fair amount in. Most post offices don't have this in their supplies area, you have to order it from online USPS. - Gas/petrol may be less expensive here but do still practice good fuel hygiene. Tint your windows so your car doesn't get as hot in the summer thus reducing or eliminating your air conditioner idling to turn your car into any sort of temperature people feel safe entering. Crack your windows whenever safe to help vent hot air. I even have these bug screens I can put over my car's doors which allows me to leave the car parked with the windows fully down and come back to a cool car with no new buggy residents; obviously only in a safe area. - Spray/treat your yard for mosquitoes. The treatment is cheaper than the medical bills from a mosquito-transmitted illness. - If you drink beer, there are two places in the US which have water equivalent in beer-making properties to London for a porter: the mountains of North Carolina and Colorado. Those are going to taste the most like porters from home. You can always ask a bar tender for a sample of anything on tap. - Any major metro area will have some version of \"The London Bridge Pub\" with slight variations to the name. They'll have all of your favorites, at an extreme markup. Time for new favorites. Cheaper favorites. - Weetabix and other goodies are available from time to time in our grocery stores depending on what is happening in trade relations with Canada. Shredded Wheat isn't Weetabix so don't waste your money. (You can obviously tell my favorite breakfast cereal.) - Our cheese, tomatoes, and bread are subpar. I'm sorry. Our water cress is still banging, tho. (I'm surely not the only one who enjoys a cheese, tomato, and water cress sandwich.) - We do indeed have PG Tips, though expensively and not widely sold. American bagged tea is made for turning into sweet tea, it is not the same as a cuppa. Loose tea is Chinese or Japanese. - Public schooling here is private schooling of the UK. You needn't pay for a private school unless your child has special circumstances which cannot be attended to in a public school. And before the haters @ me, \"special circumstances\" is not me saying anything negative, it can be a child who learns best in a forest school or someone who needs a school that has a serious and fantastic lacrosse program because you're looking at a lacrosse scholarship for college or any number of things. - If your exterior walls of your house aren't insulated, insulate them. It will more than pay for itself. Same with insulating the attic as well as adding vent fans to the attic.",
      "I'm a Brit living in North Carolina. Everyone uses their dryer here - it's really rare to see any laundry hung on the line. Medical care is expensive. WIth my kids it's always been a \"how sick are you\" type conversation before I schedule an appointment. Urgent cares are more expensive than your \"regular\" doctor so get established quickly with a regular doc. If you order take-away - find the menu on the actual store website - don't order through doordash or Uber eats - it's typically marked up a little on those sites. Door Dash is really common in the USA (but will add up quickly if you door dash a lot of food!) People will tell you that Costco / Big Box stores are great value but you might actually spend more money in there than if you didn't have a membership! I know you have Costco in the UK anyway so you're familiar with that. If your house has duel zone AC units - this will save you a bit of money. I have an upstairs temp and a downstairs temp. I keep upstairs at 74 during the day and put it down to 71 for sleeping. I keep downstairs at 74 typically and don't really touch it. Postage back to England is SOOO expensive. Avoid using the post office for this. There are better services around. (Moonpig is a great website for sending a card/gift directly to someone in England right from your computer/phone!) Good luck!",
      "You're gonna want AC in Hotlanta, but most places you move to will already have it, so saving money means using a setback thermostat to economize, and window AC units where possible. Is it cheaper to let the house warm up during the day or do you keep it cool all day? It depends on how much the house leaks air. If the house is leaky, old, drafty, it's much cheaper to shut off your AC when you leave. If your house is sealed and insulated like a picnic cooler, it doesn't cost much to leave it cold all day. As with heat, smaller areas are cheaper to cool. Window units can cool one room while you let the others go hot. Especially for sleeping. Many landlords and HOAs don't allow window units. Portable units generally suck. Whatever your AC arrangements, if you have a quiet room fan blowing directly on you then 78 on the thermostat feels like 74. This is once your AC has DRIED the air. Then fans are really effective. If your sweat doesn't evaporate you get heat stroke. Stay hydrated, my friend. Put lots of sugar in your tea and none in your grits. Don't mention blood pudding.",
      "First, happy Juneteenth. Us and UK Building systems can be very different, so I would get to know your house is vital systems far before you ever make your first phone call to a technician. Look at the type of plumbing, heating and air conditioning, wall systems, electrical, Etc and take a good pulse of your whole home. READ YOUR INSURANCE POLICY. Check what is and isn't covered. There's a trend in insurance dropping coverage due to drone footage of the property showing damage. Sometimes fire or flooding isn't included but is a whole separate insurance. There's a lawyer named Mike who practices in Georgia and talks extensively about this on YouTube. Look him up. You can and should check the license of the plumber/electrician/general contractor you use as well as making sure they are bonded and insured. The trades are necessary but residential small work can be expensive because they are losing the opportunity to get bigger jobs. Workers can run away with your deposit and homeowners can get overwhelmed with decisions when a pipe bursts, so having some DIY or at least knowledge can avoid the 'tuition fee' of an emergency call. When you get any major job done on your house, always get 3 quotes. Plumbing: galvanized, copper, PEX, mix of them? How old? If Pex, type Air B? Pex plumbing is learnable for homeowners. The electric expansion tool is something I bought used and keep. HVAC: what kind of hot water heater do you have, and what maintenance is required? Tank water heaters require regular flushes that are often not performed and so do tankless. What year is your condenser, and how do you keep the grate clean? Have you changed your air filter/s in the last month? If not, time to check on them Wall systems: older homes (1940s is when it changes) could have lathe and plaster vs drywall. Drywall up to 1980s (not 70s, that's just when the laws changed) could contain asbestos, so before cutting into it get a test. Labs sell kits on Amazon and give results online. Insulation: if it's small rocks it's vermiculite and probably contains asbestos any asbestos work and you should look at the Libby foundation, since there is funding for remediation. The spot where the chimney meets the house always leaks first, and you are in hurricane \ud83c\udf00 country. Locate your attic access and crawl space access. Electric \u26a1 up to 1950s could be knob and tube Cloth clad wire is a fire hazard, but if it's insulated directly with plastic coating it's considered acceptable if you leave it alone Federal Pacific, Zinsco, and especially STAB-LOC electric panels are recalled and a huge fire hazard. Prices for repairs have shot up 200%+ since pre pandemic, commiserate with supply chain problems and skill loss. There's a pretty good way to ROI with insulation but I wouldn't bother until around maybe October - air seal. Finally again, it's Juneteenth, so tell someone happy Juneteenth and tip heavily. Your community members need support.",
      "Set the thermostat and don't touch it. Shop around for auto insurance. Do this pretty much at towards the end of your policy term. There is ZERO benefit to being loyal to a company. Find a \"FARMER'S MARKET.\" They go by different names and are sometimes Asian or Latino owned. These are brick-and-mortar stores, not pop-up parking lot stands. You will find the cheapest produce here. Gat a \"NO SOLICITING\" sign. Your move is public record and you will have contractors of all types knocking on your door (and sending junk mail) to replace roofing, windows, paint, siding. -find the local FB group and introduce yourself. The folks there can be helpful in finding services (when they're not gossiping). -see if your town has a website. Some are better than others. In My town you can report potholes, downed branches, roadkill, and other issues. They respond pretty quickly.

Trampolines and pools can also increase the cost of insurance. Pools require fencing around them to prevent drowning. I assume an inspector would mention that if there's a pool on inspection. Umbrella insurance coverage is relatively inexpensive and might be worthwhile. Don't hire anyone that knocks on your door. Especially after storms there are lots of scammers. Make sure you have adequate car insurance coverage. It might not be cheaper up front, but it's more frugal if you ever have an accident.

      "Yes, many things. My husband and sometimes myself do little side hustles where we clean out estates. He works with Tate Real estate now that we moved here but we did similar things before we moved. TONS of cleaning supplies, kitchen ware, linens and blankets, house hold goods etc\u2026we just did one. Few weeks ago where we got all that I just mentioned. Tools, used lawn mowers and lawn equipment. What we don\u2019t use ( we have five acres and do very light home steading) we are putting into his cavernous workshop to fix and/or resell it at flea markets. It\u2019s more his hobby than mine. I really have to watch him like a hawk because I\u2019m all about having just one right thing. I\u2019m more of a minimalist and although I enjoy estate sales, flea markets, garage sales etc\u2026I very seldom buy anything unless I love, love, love it or can really use it in the now.",
      "I did the estate sale for a neighbor that passed. Her son lives out of the country and asked me to do it. Oh boy, it was a ton of work!!! Very organized woman, just a lot of stuff. We visited with her a lot , especially after her husband passed. That was 8 years ago. I haven\u2019t bought foil, plastic baggies, paper plates, few other things since then. We still have smithy foil for prob 10 more years. Oh we paid for it, but it was cheap. She had 2 of the huge commercial rolls too, just opened the second one. Cost us $12 for all of it She had neat stuff. Issue of Ebony when MLK was killed, in pristine condition. Another original magazine from when JFK was assassinated. Lots of pricey items. I had to painstakingly look this stuff up and figure out how to price it. I bought some much sought after old Xmas ornaments too. We brought in about $40K, we got a % and then we paid for our items. She had 5 antique sewing machines that worked perfectly! She was a seamstress long ago. I bought one, the one worth the least, just as an ode to her. It sits on a dresser, it is beautiful. She had the most beautiful furniture ever, all solid burl wood. Estate sales are where you find stuff back when it was built to last!",
      "Garden supplies. Tools, pots, seed starter set ups, potting soil, fertilizer, pesticides (careful here. Some are no longer legal. One box had an original bottle of DDT!!!), PVC, drip supplies, gloves, plant supports, markers, shade cloth, weed barrier, composters, and yard art. Often you can get house plants or cuttings. I also buy the entire contents of the top desk drawer. The postage stamps that are included often offset the cost. Any hobbies that require specialized tools: we\u2019ve purchased tool boxes containing all the tools necessary for cake decorating, leatherwork (including shoe making), quilting, woodgraining, oil painting, specialized pasta, fly tying, scrapbooking, mosaic, yarn/needle/sewing crafts, jewelry making, beer making, canning, and more. Keep in mind that we had no experience with any of these crafts previously. But for a modest price, we gave them a whirl and enjoyed many of them. Most sales had the accompanying \u201chow to\u201d books and specialized journals available. Also, we could walk away with old towels, sheets, diabetic syringes, and pet supplies to donate to our favorite animal rescue. Shovels, rakes, hoses, and wheel barrows went to either the botanical gardens or the horse rescue. All in all, we cruise estate sales and redistribute to scouts, seniors, schools, or whatever charities hit our radar.",

I am a full time eBay clothing seller so I do go through a lot of laundry supplies due to cleaning my inventory. I love oxiclean but no way will I pay $14 a tub at Target. Instead I get a half full tub for $2 and consider myself lucky. I pick up any laundry or cleaning product that looks useful, usually for a dollar or two. During last weekend\u2019s estate sale trip I got a brand new in package ironing board for $2.50 and a giant Costco pack of white tissue paper for $1. At another store I found a pack of 20 quality coat hangers and the sale runner waved her hand and told me to take them for free. Everyone else is looking for Gucci and Chanel. I\u2019m checking out the linen closet. I\u2019ll try anything I can wash in hot water and Mr Clean!",

This includes art for the walls, furniture and small kitchen appliances, dishes, etc. I've also managed to find better quality clothing that fits me at some estate sales for a fraction of their cost ($5 dollar fashion brand cashmere coat, for example). Sometimes, I'll find unexpired and unopened food we'd use for super prices... tools or duct tape, screws, nails... things I need to repair stuff around our home, etc. Last weekend I found a bunch of free books to read at one because it was the last day, they were hindered by their wi-fi not working and so were only doing cash/Venmo. I found a Clive Barker book.. and a copy of The Necronomicon.. for free. I also found *a gallon* container of Urine/Odor eliminator that I use... for $1.. and it was actually 50 cents because it was their half-off day. I definitely pick up stuff like tin foil, cleaning supplies, cooking oils (if unopened), alcohol and other random supplies through estate sales these days."

      "I\u2019ve been using cloth pads and recently bought a few pairs of period underwear. I also have a menstrual cup but I have gained weight and have a hard time getting it in and out than I did before I loved it but don\u2019t use it much at all anymore. The reusable pads are amazing and I love them- the period underwear doesn\u2019t work for my very heavy days but I can double up on pad and underwear too and it\u2019s nice. For swimming on a period I do use a one time use tampon but only rarely as I\u2019m not a swimmer on my period often personally. I\u2019ve used cloth pads for eight years and they have paid for themselves many times at this point. They feel less plasticy and sweaty than one use pads- I didn\u2019t realize how plastic the one use pads felt until I had to buy some one a trip for an unexpected period (I now pack a few cloth pads for trips no matter what now) and the one use plastic was awful when I tried them again for that trip. It felt suffocating down there. When/ if you get cloth pads make sure to get different sizes they make a panty liner size and it is lovely for spotting. I have periods from hell with how heavy they are and the mega pads are great and unless I\u2019m wearing tight thin clothes they don\u2019t show through ever- even in my daily wear of all colors of yoga pants. They don\u2019t ride up your backside like plastic pads do- they don\u2019t even go up as far at all- and I\u2019ve never had leaking issues. Start trying some panty liner size ones- like 2-3 and use them for end of period or beginning of period spotting to try them out. They\u2019re also great for reducing the possibility of yeast infections from working out because they are easy to use while working out then you can just take them off and you have no sweat on your underwear.",
      "I only use period underwear at this point. I use the period company brand. I absolutely love the fit, I've never had a leak even on my heaviest days and I've been using them for over 2 years, my oldest pairs are still going strong and just as absorbent as they were when I bought them. You don't get that wet feeling when you wear them. The don't feel bulky or like they stick out the same as when you wear a pad. They have plenty of different styles for women, including thongs and boxer briefs. They even have specific ones meant for wearing overnight on your heaviest flow days. I really cannot say more good things about this brand and its products because I find them to be incredibly good quality. The best part is they aren't even that much money and pay for themselves within a couple months of use. They also often have sales. They're super easy to wash, straight in the washing machine and dryer. 100% I recommend them to every person who bleeds down there because they are the best as far as I'm concerned. Also now Walmart sells them which is amazing because their online store is always sold out lol.",
      "I get mine from tree hugger cloth pads and have had them for about 5 years. When I first got them I\u2019d prewash them when taking them off to avoid staining, but the past few years I don\u2019t care and just throw them in my laundry and wash them with everything else. They\u2019re stained but don\u2019t smell or anything. Honestly the best decision I\u2019ve made, getting cloth pads instead of literally anything else. They\u2019re sooo comfy and they\u2019re super easy to clean",
      "I use Lil Helper reusable pads. I quite like that you can get many different lengths, with or without wings, and they will hold a lot of liquid. They are also machine washable, but I hand wash them, it's easy to do it. They are hard to stain & even if you do, it barely shows. They offer discounts to try them & if you can't really afford them, they will sell at a discount without proof required. They also have awesome mats called lifesaver mats that will save your mattress if you are someone like me who will leak past the back of a pad every time because it just wicks up the butt crack The mat doesn't move, is comfy & machine washable too! https://lilhelper.ca/",
      "I've had my period undies for almost 10 years. They're a little bleached atp, but hey, they're period underwear, right? The label says not to put them in the dryer, but I'm ungovernable, so I do anyway and they're fine. They're Thinx, I think. I also have a June menstrual cup that works really well and was very cheap when I bought it ($6.99 \"going out of business\" sale). I used to get super heavy periods (before my current BC and hormone regimen), so I used both out of necessity. Now I use both just out of habit, plus they're both very comfortable and make me feel completely secure. I've tried both disposable and reusable disks, but they've never worked for me. Way too leaky, slipping out of place, and super messy. I like the June cup because it has a little knob at the end that you can pull on without having to stick your fingers completely inside yourself to retrieve it, and you can neatly empty it into a toilet or shower."

The fabric is as little synthetic as can still be functional. I hate the slinky, sweat trapping not cotton, shudder. But more importantly, the protection goes band to band. I paid hundreds of dollars, trying all of the brands. The absorbent layer stops so low in front that I bleed over them. They are comfy enough that my daughter and I wear them every day. They are just our undies. I didn't have enough cycles to try more cups/discs etc. But the handful of times I used the salt disc, it was life changing. Like I wasn't even bleeding except when I peed. Put it in, dumps when I sit on the toilet. I did have a hell of a time getting it out, needs more than just a lip.",
      "I use the saalt menstrual cup. I\u2019ve had two children and am on hormonal birth control, so ymmv, but I can use it every day of my period. I dump it out more frequently on heavier days, but if I have it in right, it doesn\u2019t leak. When I empty it in the toilet, I just wipe it out with toilet paper and re-insert it. I sanitize it by filling a mug with water and microwaving it for 3 minutes.",

They've been life changing for me--I just have to change them every 24 hours, sometimes every 12 hours the first day or two. My period is on the lighter side, though I could imagine they might be a pain in the ass for someone with a heavy flow.",
      "You've already had some great feedback here, but I just wanted to mention a specific issue I experience with period underwear that I don't often see discussed. They make me sweat like crazy. They cause awful swamp ass for me, and I'm not generally a hugely sweaty person. it could be that other brands would be fine, but I wanted to mention it.",

The container in this pic looks like a regular container full of veggies, but it has an insert that has holes in it and is raised a fraction of an inch off the bottom. This keeps the veggies from sitting in the moisture that tends to collect at the bottom of the container, and makes them last longer. I also add a piece of cotton fabric to the top before putting the lid on so any moisture that condenseson the lid doesn't drip down on he veggies but rather gets absorbed by the fabric. I fully expect a container of prepped cut veggies like this to keep for about a week in the fridge - not that it will, I will have eaten most of it in 3-4 days. For something like lettuce or kale, I have had luck chopping, rinsing and then spin drying a few days worth at a time, and then transferring to a similar container lined with cotton fabric that goes under the lettuce and comes up the sides, and another on top. The uncut heads get stored in containers similar to the veggies above, as dothinks like pak choi. I also have another deeper container that stacks on top of these that has no lid - I put things like eggplants, ears of corn, whole zucchini, etc in there. Kind of like a fruit basket, but in the fridge. This system has worked really well for me - the containers are restaurant supply quality 1/3 pans - they come in a variety of depths, but all the inserts and lids can mix and match (as long as you buy the same brand). This makes it easy for me to just stack them in my fridge while keeping everything visible, which minimizes waste because something disappeared down the ADHD rabbit hole of invisiblity.",

If you use those Swiffer dusters, and I do, just mist them with any cleaning stuff and go slowly. Re-mist once they get dry. It helps the dust stick and not just fly around. Yes to air purifier and turn it up high when you're dusting. Never sweep with a broom and never dry dust. Vacuum should be fine if it's a true HEPA. The dusting attachment can be a lifesaver. Avoid shoes in the house. leather furniture and hard floors and blinds rather than curtains. Wash any rugs and curtain and soft stuff like your comforter etc often. And after you clean you will have to rinse out your nose and take a shower and wash hair, otherwise you're just wearing your allergens. So just plan accordingly and clean before you take your shower for the day.",

I do have area rugs, but they\u2019re easier to get clean. You can roll them up and clean underneath. There\u2019s no rug pad to hold on to dust and mold. You can even send them out to a professional. Replacing them doesn\u2019t require a contractor. I have some nicer wool rugs in public spaces, but I also have some washable ones in rooms that see a lot of pet hair. My main vacuum cleaner is HEPA certified and uses HEPA bags to trap dust. I do have a robovac and a stick vac that aren\u2019t. Those are for quick cleanups between thorough vacuuming. Dust first then vacuum. I prefer to dust with a slightly damp cloth to trap dust. I do use Swiffer dusters sometimes, too. After dusting, I wait awhile for anything to settle, then vacuum. I also wipe down or vacuum my upholstered furniture frequently to get rid of pet hair and dust. I love books but my allergies do not. I\u2019ve gotten rid of most of them and have read using a Kindle for years. Most of our books live in my spouse\u2019s office. I do also have a closed bookcase. Most storage in my house is closed storage to avoid things getting dusty. Clutter is the enemy. It all needs dusting. I find it easier to just have less stuff. All my bedding is machine washable and gets washed weekly. That includes the quilt. I don\u2019t have a big, thick comforter. My quilt is not down-filled and can be washed and dried weekly like everything else. My mattress and pillows have covers that are supposed to minimize dust.

It's not as useful under chairs and things though."

      "Some products are using \u201crefills\u201d as a method of greenwashing, so be careful and remember that not all refills are created equal. There was a cosmetic packaging expert on YT who did a video about this, but I can\u2019t remember her name. Effective refills use less packaging compared to the traditional packaging, but some refills may not be recyclable whereas the original type of packaging may be. If you have a refill store near you that lets you refill your own containers, that\u2019s better than commercially available refills, but commercially available refills can still decrease the amount of plastic packaging used. For some types of refills, the benefit is only seen once you\u2019ve refilled enough times as well, so I just wouldn\u2019t take a company\u2019s word for it.",
      "I get refills for our liquid dish detergent (I tried powder but it seemed like we went through it soooo quickly and it was a lot more expensive) from Grove Collective and it comes in aluminum packaging, so I\u2019m much more confident that gets recycled compared to plastic. For laundry detergent, we use powdered detergent (Nellies) and get the biggest bucket we can (which I think is 800 loads) which lasts us 1 year. I couldn\u2019t find a bar shampoo that worked for my hair type, so I\u2019m still using a liquid one, but I buy a big size so it takes a while to get through. Skincare I am just recycling the empties at Sephora (no clue if it actually gets recycled, but better chances than compared to my curbside program I think).",
      "As far I know, most refills will use less plastic for the one large container vs the 3+ individual packages that you would buy. Obviously this would vary item to item, but I feel like it\u2019s true for most items I\u2019ve used. Especially for things like cleaning spray. The concentrates can make like 30+ full bottles of spray. Reusing a spray bottle vs buying 30+ plastic spray bottles with the same product inside saves on at least 29 bottles of plastic. Know what I mean? You can then also factor in the supply chain process too. I\u2019m not super familiar with this, so I\u2019ll let someone else possibly chime in on that.",

California law allows customers to bring their own reusable cups for refills, provided the process is contamination-free. Some coffee shops, like Starbucks, even encourage the use of personal cups by offering discounts or other incentives. California Law: California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 114075 allows for the use of personal, reusable cups for refills as long as the refilling process is free from contamination. No Cross-Contamination: The law emphasizes that there should be no direct contact between the pouring utensil and the lip-contact area of the customer's cup, and that the process must be contamination-free. Voluntary Participation: While the law permits the use of reusable cups, it doesn't require coffee shops to accept them. Some establishments may have their own policies or concerns about cross-contamination.",

      "I live in a smaller town in California in one of the redder areas where people are still resistant to a lot of changes. That said, most places have no issue with me using my reusable cups. They just have specific protocols for how that happens. Starbucks for example, where I usually get an iced shaken espresso will make the drink in their shaker and then at the counter where they hand out the drinks they will pour it into my cup for me. They will not take my cup behind the counter. I had one person take my cup behind the counter but that's because they got my order wrong and took it to dump it out so they could remake my order. At Panera I fill my cup up at the fountains myself. They do have a couple of drinks behind the counter But if I want those they will pour it in one of their own cups and hand it to me and I dump it into my cup. I have no issue with collecting Panera cups however, I save them for seed starting in my garden. I know at Burger King when I ordered food and asked if I could just get water in my yeti the manager somehow got involved and told me he couldn't take my cup behind the counter (and for some reason myself) So he made multiple trips with a small water cup filling it repeatedly and pouring it into my yeti which was sitting at the counter. I have no idea what the logic there was but okay. Next time I go to the Human Bean or Dutch Brothers, I'll see if they are willing to use my yeti. Over almost places seem to be okay with my using my cup as long as it doesn't involve them having to take it behind the counter. In the case of a coffee shop I'm guessing that means cold drinks that are made in a shaker will not involve the use of one of their disposable cups but hot drinks might because those tend to be made directly in the disposable cup while cold drinks are usually made in a shaker or blender. The other thing I just thought of is that a lot of these types of places that make their drinks have markings on their disposable cups that the employees use as a guide for how much milk or ice to add, so asking them to make the drink in your cup becomes harder as they no longer have those guides to go by.",
      "I\u2019ve never had an issue in Michigan, other than during the heights of COVID, so I wonder if it\u2019s something that they got stricter about during that time.

We don't cut to order, so we don't deal with this request, but employees have mentioned before how we could save plastic by letting customers bring their own container. Once you put something in that container, your company is responsible for everything in it. So if the customer eats it and gets sick, they will blame you even if it was the germs in their own cup that caused the illness. From the company's perspective, it's likely not worth the risk.",
      "I don't know about CA, but in PA there's an amusement park that has told me multiple years that it's against policy to directly refill a customer's water bottle. And while I get it, it feels so wasteful to watch them then fill a cup (often styrofoam!) and hand it to me to pour into my own bottle. Once they wouldn't even reuse the cup even though they were standing right there and saw it touched nothing, so they gave me THREE separate styrofoam cups. Completely defeated the purpose. I write to them every year begging for a water bottle refill station to avoid this issue. I don't understand how the vendor filling the bottle would be any different from a water refill station :("

A few of things to consider: Glass is very heavy to process which makes it inefficient (and hazardous if broken)to recycle. Glass is made from sand so there is plenty of sand around\u2014 there is no real value to it\u2014 transporting them is another form of greenhouse gas emissions that contributes to climate change. Glass should be reused as much as possible before it must be recycled. Others have mentioned reuse/refill and that is what I do with glass containers. If you have a local refill store, bring them your jars so people can refill without having to buy packaging. Glass in the landfill is much better than plastic, compost, aluminum\u2014 by a long shot. If you want to look into recycling, source separated recycling is best. This means collecting a lot of glass (no lids/etc) and dropping off at a reputable source that only processes glass. Depending on where you are, your local municipality can help you find a source. Some orgs, like glass half full in Nola, is doing just that\u2014 and I love them to death for it. Hope this helps!!!",

      "It's hard to be sure if materials are all being recycled, but you can probably find out more about the actual recycling rate for glass and plastic in your city. I'd still stick with glass for a couple of reasons: some of it is almost certainly being recycled, if not all. It is much easier and cheaper to recycle glass than plastic, for several reasons, so if your city is failing to recycle everything, it's probably the plastic that's failing. Plastic is made from petroleum, so the upstream source material is already worse. That alone makes glass better. Plastic produces off-gassing as it deteriorates, an unmeasured, unknown form of toxic waste. So microplastic in the environment (or in your body) is doubly nasty. Glass is inert.

    "pros": [
      "So first of all, these kinds of bags should be used hundreds if not thousands of times. They're not meant to be disposable like plastic ones which means they aren't going to fall apart after a few uses. Additionally, single use plastic bags won't break down in a land fill. Canvas or cotton will. And then the other thing you have to think about is how often are you buying reusable bags? You pay 10cents for every plastic bag you use when you go to the store, but reusable bags are typically $1-$5. You're not buying new ones every time you go. So does one commercially available canvas bag use more resources than 100 plastic bags? Let's say the answer is yes. How many plastic bags do you think you would go through in a year? If you shop twice a week on average and get at least one bag every time, thats 104 bags per year minimum. More kf you have a larger family and walk out of a grocery store with 5 bags of stuff every time you shop. And you do this every year for for, what, 50 years minimum? So how many canvas bags will you buy in a year? In your first year you may buy 5 at one time. Now you can use 5 bags at the store and have 0 of them be plastic. So instead of 104 bags you bought 5. And the next year? Maybe one or two if you think you need more bags in other sizes. And people like to collect things and buy cute things. So maybe you accumulate 20 whole bags of the course of a few years. How many uses do you get out of each bag? If I had to guess...200-500 depending on how well you care for them and if you don't over stuff them. Thats a lot of money saved and a lot of plastic that didn't have to go to the landfill. I think the extra resources are worth it. But this doesn't even consider the fact that you can make your own or use other bags you have lying around. You dont have to buy special grocery bags.",
      "Well, as long as you reuse it regularly and don't forget them and buy new bags every time you should be good. My recommendation is to sew a pocket with a button attached to fold it into and then you always have one in your car or purse. Like the little bags grandmas have that fold up into a little pouch. It's easy to make on both machine and sewing by hand You can use any fabric and don't need much: an old shirt, a cuff off jeans you don't wear anymore (old jeans are honestly a great replacement for canvas without buying new), thrift a piece of cloth and save the rest for patches or to stuff something later.",
      "So, kind of, but the issue is, these studies only consider the energy used to create it. Does a cotton tote bag take more energy to create than a plastic bag? Obviously. But there\u2019s more to the issue than that. If you use 5,000 plastic bags instead of 1 cotton tote bag and then you\u2019re \u201ceven\u201d on creation emissions. One cotton tote bag makes little to no impact on landfill space, if an animal eats it, it\u2019s likely nothing bad will happen to them, compared to eating a plastic bag, or how much space 5,000 plastic bags take up in a landfill. Or how many microplastics those bags release into drinking water. Long story short, it\u2019s complicated. If your problem is only with creation emissions, single use plastic bags might be the best option, but there\u2019s so many other problems with single use plastic bags tote bags solve.",
      "I have a lot of reusable bags. Probably too many, but I keep several in each car and gave some to my kid for his shopping needs. I try to keep the thinner ones in my purse in case I have impromptu shopping trips. I appreciate that Costco just puts it all back in the cart. I kind of wish I could request that everywhere. Except for rainy or bitterly cold days I prefer to pack my purchases at the car in the order that makes sense to me at my leisure. It's much easier not to accidentally leave out a tub of yogurt if it's packed in a bag with all the refrigerator items Giving people the option to just put it back in the cart would help the rest of my family who has the bags in the car, but forget to bring them in. I think a prompt at the register that says \"Reusable bags in the car? No problem! We can repack your cart!\u201d Or a sign at the entryway that says \"Did you forget your reusable bags?\" could prompt a lot of people to run back for their bags. I have to believe there's no good business reason to encourage paper or plastic. More customers bringing their own has to reduce costs. A little signage could go a long way",

They'll put out something shocking like, \"You'd need to use it thousands of times!\" Without showing the direct comparison to if you'd used single use bags instead. And that's a one to one comparison they ignore. My reusable bags hold 2-3x the amount of groceries. So do I count each trip as two trips because it's two bags? And the way people bag milk and similarly heavy items locally. It's usually double bagged. Plus at the end you'll see a number like, \"52 uses,\" which is the more appropriate number to use. Do I count my reusable bags by use, or by replaced uses? And the ones that blame consumers for some big companies switching to using reusable bags as single use in places where single use bags are banned? Doubly insincere. They're trying to tell me that a company finding a loop hole to hurt the environment is everyone's fault who shops there, but the company doing it? I don't see these companies saying how often those thick plastic shampoo bottles should be reused. Or the plastic wrap on pallets. Nothing on the company end is listed ever, *except* when they feel they can blame the consumer. The newest bags I have are some target bags from the pandemic and a bag I caught during a windy day. The oldest bags I have are an over 20 year old tote and a jean bag I made from some unrepearable jeans. But, if it does concern you still. And I completely understand if it does. Check out your local thrift store! They usually have random cotton or similar shopping bags. That starts you at neutral because it was at risk for the garbage.",
      "Not supporting the plastic bag industry is another reason. You are decreasing overall consumption of plastic bags. I also find that not having excess plastic bags lying around leads me to be more likely to find more sustainable, zero-waste ways to do other things. Eg, if I don\u2019t have a plastic bag for my wet swimsuit, I\u2019ll just roll it up in my towel til I get home. If I\u2019m gathering stuff to give away, instead of filling used plastic bags and dropping those off, I put the stuff in a reusable bag or a basket and unload it at the thrift store. I think these tiny habits, good or bad, add up to larger decisions about how to live life.",

Those plasticky ones you can get at the store for a nominal amount of money are not as sturdy because the straps can break, but with those, I just sew them back together. The big problem with those skimpy disposable plastic bags is that they get everywhere, go down the waterways and interfere with everything in the waterways (animals, plants, birds) and fuck things up for people who are fishing (I use the argument with Republicans that those plastic bags interfere with MEN WHO NEED JOBS IN THE FISHING INDUSTRY - which has worked with them and is true). If you don't pay for a thing, you don't respect it. That's why those free plastic bags are one use and just chucked around everywhere. You won't see that with a reusable bag you paid money for.",
      "IDK, sounds like something big plastic would say\u2026 I\u2019ve been using my washable canvas/cotton bags for well over a decade now, so I\u2019m sure that wouldn\u2019t be true in my case, but \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Plastic is poisoning us all, so I try to avoid it whenever possible.",

We\u2019ll do this until we can\u2019t physically get it inside anymore. It doesn\u2019t have that Douglas fir smell, but does look pretty similar. Edit: In US. Zone 9b. Tree did fantastic outside and even survived a couple hurricanes. Bought it from a big box for like $25",

      "You would/could still kill the tree. Trees require a certain number of consecutive days below a certain temperature every year (varies by species, usually below 0\u00b0 C) in order to \"sleep\". It's a part of their cycle. Disrupting the cycle enough will kill the tree. Many trees may be able to recover from this 'lack of sleep' after the first year but multiple years in a row will 100% kill the tree if it's not able to recoup the days after the Christmas season (of course this will vary depending on location). In some cases the tree may seem unharmed and even live several months to years after sleep loss and then still die from the trauma it received on the first year. I only know this because it's a super important rule in bonsai. I know collectors that live in warm climates and keep their trees in refrigerators during the winter.",
      "Odd thought: can we sequester dead Christmas trees? Every year, millions of Americans pay for a tree to be grown, delivered, and thrown out. Can we just... bury them? Put that carbon back underground?",
      "Ok, so don\u2019t get me wrong cool idea and all, but I would think that Christmas three farms that constantly grow and chop down their trees actually would sequester more carbon and me more sustainable than a \u201creuse the tree\u201d model, right? Younger trees grow faster, sucking up more carbon. Then when they are Chicopee down and die they decompose and leave at least some of that carbon in the ground. Whereas here we just have a tree that will sequester carbon slower as it grows older?",
      "I hate to be that guy but... this is a terrible idea. Cutting down trees isn't actually a terrible thing, if they are constantly replanted. Infact young trees sequester more carbon than older trees, because they grow super quickly. Unsustainable clearing is bad. Sustainable replanting isn't. These trees can all be composted (releases some co2) but the net process would still be co2 negative. Now instead think about the logistics chain involved in collecting all these trees, driving them back to the plot, replanting them ,etc. Thats a ton of carbon being spent when the alternative action is to just drop a seed in the ground when you harvest the tree. That action costs zero carbon. Driving those trees around to replant them costs a ton of carbon. Now also consider the failure rate of keeping a tree ina pot like this with a stunted tap root, and stunted seeker roots. These trees will be incredibly weak and will need a ton of support to stay alive, which means more carbon, even if its just irrigation water. For example, picture 2 different cases of a tree in their 7th year. One is this tree which has been replanted and dug up 3 or so times already, and its stunted destroyed root system. The other is a seedling that has grown in the same spot for 7 years. Which one is healthier and less reliant on help to survive? The seedling by far. For anyone that wants tree planting, garden or ecosystem design advice, I run a youtube channel called [Canadian Permaculture Legacy](https://youtu.be/gDeFwvHTOfs). My goal is to get more people planting trees, but doing it the right way. Making a forest, not pines in lines. TLDR this is a really good example of humans doing the exact wrong thing with good intentions.",

I've only been able to find it on Walmart.com ( https://www.walmart.com/ip/Old-Spice-Clean-Ocean-Deodorant-for-Men-Plastic-Free-Packaging/626716307 ) and when they shipped it to me they put a little bubble wrap in the box \ud83d\ude24 but judging by the size of the box, if you bought maybe around 3 maybe they won't include any in the shipment? It says \"limited edition\" which is frustrating, but maybe if we email them and leave reviews, tweet about it etc. they'll have incentive to continue production... And maybe eventually they'll convert their product line completely one day if we keep pushing. It's important to try to convert these big box store companies as much as it is to elevate and support our smaller environmentally friendly businesses. .

      "I\u2019m late to the party but want to provide some context. This type of packaging is likely due to limitations on the manufacturing line equipment. This product is low volume. So it can\u2019t afford to have its own dedicated manufacturing line where every piece of equipment can optimize production. These companies care about zero waste from an economic perspective. There are lots of manufacturing lines that can produce sausage patties very efficiently. Unfortunately just about every available one manufactures meat products. And the target demographic for this product wouldn\u2019t appreciate the box saying \u201cMANUFACTURED ON SHARED EQUIPMENT THAT ALSO HANDLES SLAUGHTERED ANIMALS\u201d So you have a low volume product that can only be packaged on a vegan manufacturing line, that has flash freeze capability. That is a very narrow landscape. This is usually outsourced to a company called a co-packer. They have very flexible equipment that can make anything but it\u2019s not going to be efficient. Every component is like an adjustable wrench within a range. This line likely says \u201cwe can move any product that is at least 4 inches wide\u201d So these plastic trays are basically \u201cjigs\u201d that let them move down the conveyor belt on a manufacturing line that is a \u201cjack of all trades, master of none\u201d.

As we have introduced new products into grocery stores, you may have noticed proactive measures to reduce packaging waste. For example, our Beyond Sausage is packed in a compostable tray and Beyond Beef does not come in a tray at all. We'll have more progress to share in the coming year. >Thank you again for your input!",
      "Packaging engineer here; Also coincidentally i recently interviewed for a position setting up this company's new packaging line in their production plant. Is there a triangle on the trays? If so, what number is inside it? That tells you what it's made of (unless it's a 7) and gives you a better idea of how wasteful it is and what capacity there is for recycling the polymers used in the trays. While it may look wasteful, if the trays are recyclable (preferably PET or maybe HDPE like many common beverage containers) it is way better than those burger patties that are wrapped in film that just goes straight into the trash. Also there is almost definitely a reason the trays are that big relating to how they are packaged on the line. The machine probably needs that much material beyond the patty to grab onto the tray and move it through the packaging process. Automation has its downsides sometimes.",

I live in a rural town and could get, quite literally, a chunk of an outdoor reared cow that grazed in the fields across the street from my boyfriend, or one my mom buys milk from, from a farmer we know, helping prevent \"old\" milk cows being shipped across the country. Or I could buy vegan meat in a ton of plastic shipped from abroad, in my situation. I'd really love to see the environmental comparison there. As in, extremely local grass fed beef vs fake beef with soy from who knows where grown who knows how, imported, lots of shipping, lots of packaging, etc. I'm honestly wondering. Wish I had the space for chickens."

So now more than ever I\u2019ve seen an increment of plastic usage/packing than the old days... in most cases.",
      "The packaging itself has a relatively small amount of material if compressed back into a plastic and cardboard base. This is still way too much, but the real impact is probably in shipping. The volume here means that extra space couldn't be packed with other goods. Which means when shipped, the fuel being burnt is transporting less than it could. Which means more fuel is burnt to transport these burgers than needs to be. And that fuel is just turning into an ever thickening blanket of chemicals that kill us and boil our little blue marble.",

Some things I did as an employee were take home the reject fries that had fallen through the grates on the cooling rack and reheating them in the oven on 400 (also works with five guys fries or any fries that are fresh and have never ever been frozen!!) for a few minutes and they crisp up so well you can\u2019t even tell!!

I was gonna just bite the bullet until I realized I could solve both problems by taking home the cups that would\u2019ve been tossed anyway!! They\u2019ve never been touched by a customer so they\u2019re perfectly good! We\u2019re also allowed to eat or take home reject/incorrectly made burgers, the BURGER restaurant has TWO vegan options, (beyond burger and a portobello mushroom sandwich, both of which are to die for \ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24), and more little things like that!!!

      "former barista/coffee master here... yes, the amount of waste at our store was staggering. But it's really not Starbucks' fault in the least. Starbucks (and basically every other corporation out there) would LOVE to donate unused supplies/food/product/machines etc. But \"lawsuit America\" is never going to allow such a thing. These coffee machines have Starbucks branding on them, and all it takes is one homeless destitute to burn himself making a shot of espresso and BAM! Starbucks is hit with a $100 million dollar lawsuit. Basically \\*any\\* kind of lawsuit over negligence is going to result in a loss for Starbucks. They're a fortune 500 company... they're at a severe disadvantage in the courtroom against a homeless guy. And even if they did win the lawsuit, they'll never be able to counter-sue for legal fees. So I'm sorry, but philanthropy and goodwill in America isn't as easy as this post makes it out to be. Even now, there have been a few scenarios I've been in where I felt compelled to reach out and help a fellow human being, but I usually refrain for fear of legal action. Just a couple weeks ago I saw a fight going on and I felt compelled to intervene and attempt to stop the two parties from beating eachother until somebody got seriously hurt. But thankfully I considered the legal repercussions for helping and decided not to. Had I decided to intervene and one of the parties fell and smacked their head and got brain damage or died, I could end up in a LOT of trouble. I wish we lived in a society where goodwill was incentivized and encouraged, but that's just not the case.",
      "My four cents: Two cents: Despite what the image says, this will be going to a scrap yard, not a landfill. Still not the optimal solution, but it's not as bad as simply burying it. Two more cents: This is less Starbuck's fault and more the fault of our litigious society and our legal system that allows it. Giving this equipment away, or even allowing people to dumpster dive, is a liability. A significant enough liability that they paid extra money for a company to mitigate it by destroying the equipment.",

      "Sadly, as a coffee shop owner - this would cut into my business significantly. Actually, I am pretty sure we would not be able to keep the doors open if I were to try and implement this. A lot of my business is walk-ins that just want a cup of coffee to go. And honestly, they are the highest margins because there is low staff overhead associated with pouring a drink. We don't have a diswasher and only have 1-2 baristas on site at a given time, so it does help form that standpoint. But we obviously have normal coffee cups/mugs and encourage people to sit and hang out - and the baristas are actually pretty successful at discouraging people from using disposable cups We do use compostable/biodegradable coffee cups, lids, plastic cups, and straws - but sadly most of it will end up in a landfill which defeats the purpose. Also, I am in Florida so respecting the environment is a pretty radical concept down here. I would say 50% at a minimum just \"prefer\" a disposable cup so they can take a half-finished drink with them and continue enjoying it. And personally, I don't have much time to sit down at a coffee shop, so expecting my customers to have the time is not realistic. Everyone is so damn busy, rushing constantly from place to place. Hooray for capitalism",

But there's no way that all of these coffee shops would continue to exist if making coffee at home was more popular. A significant chunk of these customers just don't make it at home. Making coffee at home is easy, good for the environment (assuming you don't use K-cups or similar), and saves you a bunch of money. You don't need a $8,000 espresso machine to make good coffee. You don't need to measure out coffee to the exact milligram. You don't need to have water at an exact pH, temperature, and hardness. You don't need to spend a ton of money on classes. You can basically eyeball and approximate things and end up with a very good cup of coffee. Coffee is pretty forgiving and unless you do something heinously wrong (taking water from a raging boil and putting it over the grinds immediately, letting it steep for a hour, etc.) you won't screw it up.",

      "I\u2019ve been using cloth pads and recently bought a few pairs of period underwear. I also have a menstrual cup but I have gained weight and have a hard time getting it in and out than I did before I loved it but don\u2019t use it much at all anymore. The reusable pads are amazing and I love them- the period underwear doesn\u2019t work for my very heavy days but I can double up on pad and underwear too and it\u2019s nice. For swimming on a period I do use a one time use tampon but only rarely as I\u2019m not a swimmer on my period often personally. I\u2019ve used cloth pads for eight years and they have paid for themselves many times at this point. They feel less plasticy and sweaty than one use pads- I didn\u2019t realize how plastic the one use pads felt until I had to buy some one a trip for an unexpected period (I now pack a few cloth pads for trips no matter what now) and the one use plastic was awful when I tried them again for that trip. It felt suffocating down there. When/ if you get cloth pads make sure to get different sizes they make a panty liner size and it is lovely for spotting. I have periods from hell with how heavy they are and the mega pads are great and unless I\u2019m wearing tight thin clothes they don\u2019t show through ever- even in my daily wear of all colors of yoga pants. They don\u2019t ride up your backside like plastic pads do- they don\u2019t even go up as far at all- and I\u2019ve never had leaking issues. Start trying some panty liner size ones- like 2-3 and use them for end of period or beginning of period spotting to try them out. They\u2019re also great for reducing the possibility of yeast infections from working out because they are easy to use while working out then you can just take them off and you have no sweat on your underwear.",
      "I only use period underwear at this point. I use the period company brand. I absolutely love the fit, I've never had a leak even on my heaviest days and I've been using them for over 2 years, my oldest pairs are still going strong and just as absorbent as they were when I bought them. You don't get that wet feeling when you wear them. The don't feel bulky or like they stick out the same as when you wear a pad. They have plenty of different styles for women, including thongs and boxer briefs. They even have specific ones meant for wearing overnight on your heaviest flow days. I really cannot say more good things about this brand and its products because I find them to be incredibly good quality. The best part is they aren't even that much money and pay for themselves within a couple months of use. They also often have sales. They're super easy to wash, straight in the washing machine and dryer. 100% I recommend them to every person who bleeds down there because they are the best as far as I'm concerned. Also now Walmart sells them which is amazing because their online store is always sold out lol.",
      "I get mine from tree hugger cloth pads and have had them for about 5 years. When I first got them I\u2019d prewash them when taking them off to avoid staining, but the past few years I don\u2019t care and just throw them in my laundry and wash them with everything else. They\u2019re stained but don\u2019t smell or anything. Honestly the best decision I\u2019ve made, getting cloth pads instead of literally anything else.

They offer discounts to try them & if you can't really afford them, they will sell at a discount without proof required. They also have awesome mats called lifesaver mats that will save your mattress if you are someone like me who will leak past the back of a pad every time because it just wicks up the butt crack The mat doesn't move, is comfy & machine washable too! https://lilhelper.ca/",

The label says not to put them in the dryer, but I'm ungovernable, so I do anyway and they're fine. They're Thinx, I think. I also have a June menstrual cup that works really well and was very cheap when I bought it ($6.99 \"going out of business\" sale). I used to get super heavy periods (before my current BC and hormone regimen), so I used both out of necessity. Now I use both just out of habit, plus they're both very comfortable and make me feel completely secure. I've tried both disposable and reusable disks, but they've never worked for me. Way too leaky, slipping out of place, and super messy. I like the June cup because it has a little knob at the end that you can pull on without having to stick your fingers completely inside yourself to retrieve it, and you can neatly empty it into a toilet or shower."

I paid hundreds of dollars, trying all of the brands. The absorbent layer stops so low in front that I bleed over them. They are comfy enough that my daughter and I wear them every day. They are just our undies. I didn't have enough cycles to try more cups/discs etc. But the handful of times I used the salt disc, it was life changing. Like I wasn't even bleeding except when I peed.

The container in this pic looks like a regular container full of veggies, but it has an insert that has holes in it and is raised a fraction of an inch off the bottom. This keeps the veggies from sitting in the moisture that tends to collect at the bottom of the container, and makes them last longer. I also add a piece of cotton fabric to the top before putting the lid on so any moisture that condenseson the lid doesn't drip down on he veggies but rather gets absorbed by the fabric. I fully expect a container of prepped cut veggies like this to keep for about a week in the fridge - not that it will, I will have eaten most of it in 3-4 days. For something like lettuce or kale, I have had luck chopping, rinsing and then spin drying a few days worth at a time, and then transferring to a similar container lined with cotton fabric that goes under the lettuce and comes up the sides, and another on top. The uncut heads get stored in containers similar to the veggies above, as dothinks like pak choi. I also have another deeper container that stacks on top of these that has no lid - I put things like eggplants, ears of corn, whole zucchini, etc in there. Kind of like a fruit basket, but in the fridge. This system has worked really well for me - the containers are restaurant supply quality 1/3 pans - they come in a variety of depths, but all the inserts and lids can mix and match (as long as you buy the same brand). This makes it easy for me to just stack them in my fridge while keeping everything visible, which minimizes waste because something disappeared down the ADHD rabbit hole of invisiblity.",

      "plastic bags actually are the worse thing to keep your veggies in . usually veggies/fruits need a cool dark place to stay fresh. many don't need to be in the fridge: apples, oranges, potatoes, pumpkins, onions, grapefruits ....etc you have plenty of natural fiber options such as wooden bowls, wicker, .... or glass. also some stuff can stay in paper bags like mushrooms"

Effective refills use less packaging compared to the traditional packaging, but some refills may not be recyclable whereas the original type of packaging may be. If you have a refill store near you that lets you refill your own containers, that\u2019s better than commercially available refills, but commercially available refills can still decrease the amount of plastic packaging used.

If you use those Swiffer dusters, and I do, just mist them with any cleaning stuff and go slowly. Re-mist once they get dry. It helps the dust stick and not just fly around. Yes to air purifier and turn it up high when you're dusting. Never sweep with a broom and never dry dust. Vacuum should be fine if it's a true HEPA. The dusting attachment can be a lifesaver. Avoid shoes in the house. leather furniture and hard floors and blinds rather than curtains. Wash any rugs and curtain and soft stuff like your comforter etc often. And after you clean you will have to rinse out your nose and take a shower and wash hair, otherwise you're just wearing your allergens. So just plan accordingly and clean before you take your shower for the day.",

You can even send them out to a professional. Replacing them doesn\u2019t require a contractor. I have some nicer wool rugs in public spaces, but I also have some washable ones in rooms that see a lot of pet hair. My main vacuum cleaner is HEPA certified and uses HEPA bags to trap dust. I do have a robovac and a stick vac that aren\u2019t. Those are for quick cleanups between thorough vacuuming. Dust first then vacuum. I prefer to dust with a slightly damp cloth to trap dust. I do use Swiffer dusters sometimes, too. After dusting, I wait awhile for anything to settle, then vacuum. I also wipe down or vacuum my upholstered furniture frequently to get rid of pet hair and dust. I love books but my allergies do not. I\u2019ve gotten rid of most of them and have read using a Kindle for years. Most of our books live in my spouse\u2019s office. I do also have a closed bookcase. Most storage in my house is closed storage to avoid things getting dusty. Clutter is the enemy. It all needs dusting. I find it easier to just have less stuff. All my bedding is machine washable and gets washed weekly. That includes the quilt. I don\u2019t have a big, thick comforter. My quilt is not down-filled and can be washed and dried weekly like everything else. My mattress and pillows have covers that are supposed to minimize dust.

A few of things to consider: Glass is very heavy to process which makes it inefficient (and hazardous if broken)to recycle. Glass is made from sand so there is plenty of sand around\u2014 there is no real value to it\u2014 transporting them is another form of greenhouse gas emissions that contributes to climate change. Glass should be reused as much as possible before it must be recycled. Others have mentioned reuse/refill and that is what I do with glass containers. If you have a local refill store, bring them your jars so people can refill without having to buy packaging. Glass in the landfill is much better than plastic, compost, aluminum\u2014 by a long shot. If you want to look into recycling, source separated recycling is best. This means collecting a lot of glass (no lids/etc) and dropping off at a reputable source that only processes glass. Depending on where you are, your local municipality can help you find a source. Some orgs, like glass half full in Nola, is doing just that\u2014 and I love them to death for it. Hope this helps!!!",

Theres brands like Ecover, Miniml and Faith in Nature, which you can order huge bottles of and store in a cupboard, then pour into the smaller glass bottles to use. I know some of the companies take the huge bottles back for refilling once emptied, or you can take them to a refill store and do it yourself and get as much as you want. So you wouldn't have to throw anything away, just make sure the glass bottles get a good clean and then label them so you're not mixing any chemicals",

Like if they get a lot, maybe it's more profitable to actually recycle it. I dont know, but I wonder if you could contact someone in the city and see if they would explain their processes?",

      "It's hard to be sure if materials are all being recycled, but you can probably find out more about the actual recycling rate for glass and plastic in your city. I'd still stick with glass for a couple of reasons: some of it is almost certainly being recycled, if not all. It is much easier and cheaper to recycle glass than plastic, for several reasons, so if your city is failing to recycle everything, it's probably the plastic that's failing. Plastic is made from petroleum, so the upstream source material is already worse. That alone makes glass better. Plastic produces off-gassing as it deteriorates, an unmeasured, unknown form of toxic waste. So microplastic in the environment (or in your body) is doubly nasty. Glass is inert. I also live in a small apartment. For me, this subreddit is somewhat aspirational. I've done well in some areas, not so well in others. Don't let the best be the enemy of the good. Stick with it.

But I assume every establishment has their own rules that you'll need to sus out.",
      "I live in a smaller town in California in one of the redder areas where people are still resistant to a lot of changes. That said, most places have no issue with me using my reusable cups. They just have specific protocols for how that happens. Starbucks for example, where I usually get an iced shaken espresso will make the drink in their shaker and then at the counter where they hand out the drinks they will pour it into my cup for me. They will not take my cup behind the counter. I had one person take my cup behind the counter but that's because they got my order wrong and took it to dump it out so they could remake my order. At Panera I fill my cup up at the fountains myself. They do have a couple of drinks behind the counter But if I want those they will pour it in one of their own cups and hand it to me and I dump it into my cup. I have no issue with collecting Panera cups however, I save them for seed starting in my garden. I know at Burger King when I ordered food and asked if I could just get water in my yeti the manager somehow got involved and told me he couldn't take my cup behind the counter (and for some reason myself) So he made multiple trips with a small water cup filling it repeatedly and pouring it into my yeti which was sitting at the counter. I have no idea what the logic there was but okay. Next time I go to the Human Bean or Dutch Brothers, I'll see if they are willing to use my yeti. Over almost places seem to be okay with my using my cup as long as it doesn't involve them having to take it behind the counter. In the case of a coffee shop I'm guessing that means cold drinks that are made in a shaker will not involve the use of one of their disposable cups but hot drinks might because those tend to be made directly in the disposable cup while cold drinks are usually made in a shaker or blender. The other thing I just thought of is that a lot of these types of places that make their drinks have markings on their disposable cups that the employees use as a guide for how much milk or ice to add, so asking them to make the drink in your cup becomes harder as they no longer have those guides to go by.",
      "I\u2019ve never had an issue in Michigan, other than during the heights of COVID, so I wonder if it\u2019s something that they got stricter about during that time. There is a local place that only allows THEIR reusable cups but they are kind of dicks overall and they steal tips from their employees so I don\u2019t go there anyway.",
      "Not directly coffee related, but similar - I work in food prep producing the cups of cut up fruit sold in the grocery store. We don't cut to order, so we don't deal with this request, but employees have mentioned before how we could save plastic by letting customers bring their own container. Once you put something in that container, your company is responsible for everything in it. So if the customer eats it and gets sick, they will blame you even if it was the germs in their own cup that caused the illness. From the company's perspective, it's likely not worth the risk.",
      "I don't know about CA, but in PA there's an amusement park that has told me multiple years that it's against policy to directly refill a customer's water bottle. And while I get it, it feels so wasteful to watch them then fill a cup (often styrofoam!) and hand it to me to pour into my own bottle. Once they wouldn't even reuse the cup even though they were standing right there and saw it touched nothing, so they gave me THREE separate styrofoam cups. Completely defeated the purpose. I write to them every year begging for a water bottle refill station to avoid this issue. I don't understand how the vendor filling the bottle would be any different from a water refill station :("

Plant extracts have numerous proven health benefits, among which are anti-ageing and skin-care properties. However, with the increased demand for plant-derived cosmetic products, there is a crucial prerequisite for establishing alternative approaches to conventional methods to ensure sufficient biomass for sustainable production. Plant tissue culture techniques, such as in vitro root cultures, micropropagation, or callogenesis, offer the possibility to produce considerable amounts of bioactive compounds independent of external factors that may influence their production. This production can also be significantly increased with the implementation of other biotechnological approaches such as elicitation, metabolic engineering, precursor and/or nutrient feeding, immobilization, and permeabilization. This work aimed to evaluate the potential of biotechnological tools for producing bioactive compounds, with a focus on bioactive compounds with anti-ageing properties, which can be used for the development of green-label cosmeceutical products. In addition, some examples demonstrating the use of plant tissue culture techniques to produce high-value bioactive ingredients for cosmeceutical applications are also addressed, showing the importance of these tools and approaches for the sustainable production of plant-derived cosmetic products.* Keywords: **antioxidants; anti-ageing; biotechnology; callus; plant tissue culture; skin**"

      "When it comes to skincare, it is easy to find yourself overwhelmed by a multitude of products promising youthful, radiant skin. Among the many options available, certain ingredients have gained significant attention in recent years, and hyaluronic acid is one of them. These skincare ingredients have become staples in the beauty industry due to their remarkable benefits and versatility. However, new treatments, such as squalane, are emerging. Understanding the key differences and unique qualities of squalane and hyaluronic acid may be essential for making informed choices about your skincare regimen. Overview In this comprehensive guide, we discuss squalane and hyaluronic acid, exploring their origins, properties, and the remarkable benefits they offer for your skin. Whether you are seeking deep hydration, anti-aging effects, or a skincare routine tailored to your specific needs, this article will equip you with the knowledge to make informed decisions and unlock the secrets of these skincare titans. In this article, we aim to demystify squalane and hyaluronic acid, shedding light on their distinct mechanisms, potential side effects, and practical tips for incorporating them into your daily skincare routine. Get ready to discover the transformative power of these ingredients and unlock the secrets to achieving healthy, glowing skin. What is squalane? Squalane is a highly stable and non-comedogenic oil derived from squalene, a natural lipid found in human skin and certain plant sources. It is known for its exceptional moisturizing properties, antioxidant benefits, and ability to improve skin texture and elasticity. With its lightweight texture and compatibility with various skin types, squalane deeply hydrates the skin, protects against environmental damage, and promotes a healthy, radiant complexion. What is hyaluronic acid? In the human body, hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring substance vital for maintaining skin hydration and lubrication. It is a glycosaminoglycan, a type of molecule that has a large water-holding capacity, making it highly effective in retaining moisture. In skincare, hyaluronic acid is derived from plant or synthetic sources and used for its exceptional hydrating properties. It can attract and bind moisture to the skin, resulting in improved skin plumpness, smoothness, and suppleness. Hyaluronic acid is a popular ingredient in many skincare products that provide intense hydration and anti-aging benefits due to its renowned versatility and compatibility with all skin types. How does squalane compare to hyaluronic acid? Squalane and hyaluronic acid are both popular skincare ingredients that offer unique benefits for the skin. However, the following are a few differences between the two: 1. Moisturizing Mechanism Squalane is an oil-based ingredient that works as an emollient, providing deep hydration and moisture retention to the skin. The protective barrier it creates on the skin's surface prevents the loss of moisture and keeps the skin hydrated and supple. On the other hand, hyaluronic acid is a water-binding molecule that attracts and holds water in the skin, acting as a humectant. It draws moisture from the environment or deeper layers of the skin and delivers it to the surface, effectively hydrating and plumping the skin. 2. Skin Penetration Compared to hyaluronic acid, squalane has a smaller molecular size, allowing it to penetrate the skin more effectively. It can reach deeper layers, providing long-lasting hydration and delivering other beneficial ingredients along with it. Hyaluronic acid, with its larger molecule size, primarily works on the surface of the skin, attracting and retaining moisture in the outer layers. 3. Texture and Application Squalane is a lightweight oil that absorbs quickly into the skin and virtually leaves no trace behind. Since it does not clog pores, it suits all skin types, including acne-prone and oily skin. On the other hand, hyaluronic acid is typically available in the form of serums, gels, or creams, and it has a watery or gel-like consistency. It is easily spreadable and quickly absorbed into the skin, providing a weightless and non-greasy feel. 4. Benefits Squalane offers deep hydration, helps to improve skin texture, and provides antioxidant protection. It is a common component in anti-aging skincare products because, in addition to regulating sebum production, it also reduces wrinkles and fine lines. The exceptional water-binding capacity of hyaluronic acid provides intense hydration and plumps the skin, helping to lessen the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It also improves skin elasticity and creates a smoother complexion. While both squalane and hyaluronic acid offer hydration benefits, their mechanisms, textures, and penetration levels differ. Incorporating both ingredients into a skincare routine can provide a comprehensive approach to achieving optimal hydration and overall skin health. Risks and Side Effects Squalane is generally considered safe for topical use and is well-tolerated by most individuals. It has a low potential for causing adverse reactions or side effects. However, as with any skincare product, there are a few considerations to keep in mind: Allergic Reactions: While rare, some individuals may be allergic to squalane. It is always advisable to perform a patch test before using squalane on a larger area of the skin, especially if you have a history of allergies or sensitivities. Consult a healthcare provider and stop using the product if you suffer any allergic reaction symptoms, including redness, itching, swelling, or rash. Contamination: To reduce the possibility of contamination, make sure you are using high-quality squalane from reliable sources. Contaminated or impure squalane may potentially cause skin irritation or other adverse effects. Individual Sensitivities: While squalane is considered non-comedogenic, meaning it is unlikely to clog pores, everyone's skin is unique. Some individuals may still experience clogged pores or breakouts when using squalane. If you notice any negative skin reactions, discontinue use and consult a dermatologist. Hyaluronic acid rarely causes significant adverse effects or allergic responses because the body naturally produces it. However, stay away from using hyaluronic acid in the below-mentioned circumstances: Allergy: When utilizing hyaluronic acid, those with a history of life-threatening allergic responses like anaphylaxis should proceed with caution. Pregnancy: You may want to refrain from taking hyaluronic acid supplements during pregnancy and while nursing because its effects during these times are still unknown. Breastfeeding: There is a lack of sufficient research to determine if hyaluronic acid use is safe during breastfeeding. It is still being studied if hyaluronic acid is excreted in breast milk and the impact it can have on a baby. Hence, avoiding the use of hyaluronic acid during breastfeeding is a safe bet. Scleroderma or hardening of the skin and connective tissue: Scleroderma patients run the risk of worsening their skin ulcers if they apply hyaluronic acid to their skin. Therefore, the use of hyaluronic acid on the skin should be avoided if you have scleroderma. Radiation therapy: While undergoing radiation therapy, applying hyaluronic acid to the skin may raise the risk of certain skin problems. Hence, it is advisable to avoid it if you are undergoing radiation therapy. The Bottom Line Both squalane and hyaluronic acid are exceptional skincare ingredients that offer unique benefits. So, whether you are seeking intense hydration, anti-aging effects, or a balanced complexion, incorporating squalane, hyaluronic acid, or both into your regimen can help you achieve healthier, more radiant skin.",

      "The skin is a physical barrier that protects our body against various environmental, chemical and physical agents, and is the main organ that is easily visible as time progresses. Aging is a dynamic, progressive and undesirable biological process that unfortunately cannot be stopped, according to present knowledge. Intrinsic aging (chronological, spontaneous and biological aging) is a programmed natural process, while extrinsic aging (environmental aging and photoaging) is associated with sun exposure, smoking and malnutrition, which weakens the skin structure and functions. Over time, aging skin starts to lose elastin fibers, collagen and other proteins, which are the basic constituents that make skin healthy, bright, fit and elastic. There has been increasing interest in studies on various molecular and hormonal mechanisms, such as hormone dysfunction, changes in signaling pathways, the downregulation of mitochondrial function with cytokine increase, and mitochondrial DNA mutation. Antiaging treatment strategies can be divided into two parts: primary (basic) preventive antiaging approaches and secondary antiaging approaches after the phenotypic features of aging are revealed. The present study aims to review the literature information on the underlying causes of skin aging, healthy skin aging, and basic protective antiaging approaches.

      "The shedding of epithelial squames (skin scales) by staff in operating theatre air is an important source for deep infection following joint replacement surgery. This is a serious complication resulting in significant morbidity for the patient and substantial cost implications for healthcare systems. Much effort has been put into providing clean-air in operating theatres, yet little attention has been given to reducing the shedding of surface skin scales at source. Aim Our aim was to develop a novel method for calculating surface skin scale density using surface microscopy and to use it to evaluate the effect of a skin care regimen on operating theatre staff. Methods Surface microscopy with Z-stacked imaging was used to visualise the effect of a skin care regimen involving three stages: washing with soap; exfoliation and emollient application. A USB microscope was then used in a field study to take images of operating theatre staff skin who applied the regimen to one lower limb the night before testing. The other limb was used as a control. Two blinded assessors analysed scale density. Results: Z-stack images from the surface microscope enabled observations of the skin care regimen. The USB microscope also provided adequate images, which enabled assessment of skin scale density.

Methods: The study was conducted in two steps; in Part I (pilot study) a panel of 20 participants ingested either 3 g a day of MSM or placebo capsules for 16 weeks. Visual and subject self assessment of wrinkles and skin texture as the predominant sign of ageing was observed. In Part II (dose-response study), 63 participants ingested either 1 g or 3 g per day of MSM for 16 weeks. Expert clinical grading, instrumental measurements and consumer perception was used to evaluate skin conditions like lines and wrinkles. Additionally, instrumentational analysis was conducted using corneometer and cutometer for investigation of skin hydration, firmness and elasticity. Results: Part I of the study clearly indicates that oral ingestion of MSM (3 g/d) reduces signs of ageing like facial wrinkles (p < 0.05) and skin roughness (p < 0.05) as compared to placebo. Detailed analysis in Part II instrumentation assessments showed a significant (p < 0.05) improvement from baseline in the severity of facial wrinkles, as well as improved skin firmness, elasticity and hydration with MSM. Some of these parameters exhibited a good dose-response indicating that the higher (3 g/d) of the supplement was more effective than the lower dose of 1 g/d, but generally the lower dose of 1 g/d appeared to be sufficiently effective in reducing the facial signs of ageing. Conclusion: This study indicated that MSM is effective in reducing visual signs of skin ageing even at a low dose of 1 g/d.* Keywords: **MSM; methylsulfonylmethane; ageing; firmness elasticity; hydration; skin; wrinkles.**"

      "Dry skin is the most common clinical manifestation of dermatologic diseases, and it presents with itching, redness, and desquamation\u2014signs and clinical manifestations that are not only physically uncomfortable but also affect patients psychologically. The water content in the stratum corneum is largely dependent on the composition and amount of the intercellular lipids, which regulate the loss of water from the skin, and on the levels of hygroscopic substances of the natural moisturizing factors, which are responsible for retention of water in the stratum corneum. Prevention of water loss and penetration of potentially toxic substances and microorganisms into the body are the most important functions of the skin, which acts as a natural frontier between the inner organism and the environment. Skin barrier defects occur in several skin diseases, but the influence of aging on the skin barrier function is largely unknown and conflicting results have been reported. In this review, the structure and function of the barrier in relation to the aging process are discussed."

      "Abstract *Photodamaged skin exhibits wrinkles, pigmented spots, dryness and tumors. Solar UV radiation induces cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) and further produces base oxidation by reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are thought to be a major factor to initiate the up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in keratinocytes and fibroblasts via activation of receptor proteins on the cell membrane of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, and to degrade fiber components in dermis, leading to wrinkle formation. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) was reported to reduce ROS production and DNA damage triggered by UVA irradiation in human keratinocytes in vitro. Further, CoQ10 was shown to reduce UVA-induced MMPs in cultured human dermal fibroblasts. We speculated that UVB radiation-induced cytokine production in keratinocytes may be inhibited by CoQ10, resulting in the reduction of MMPs in fibroblasts leading to wrinkle reduction. Our in vitro studies showed that UVB-induced IL-6 production of normal human keratinocyte (NHKC) decreased in the presence of CoQ10. Furthermore, MMP-1 production of fibroblasts cultured with the medium containing CoQ10 collected from UVB-irradiated NHKC significantly decreased during 24 h culture. In the clinical trial study, we found that the use of 1% CoQ10 cream for five months reduced wrinkle score grade observed by a dermatologist. Taken together, our results indicate that CoQ10 may inhibit the production of IL-6 which stimulate fibroblasts in dermis by paracrine manner to up-regulate MMPs production, and contribute to protecting dermal fiber components from degradation, leading to rejuvenation of wrinkled skin.*"

      "I was in California and I loved the eye cream so I bought that for both night and days spent like $350 just on the creams but I figured it was worth it if it really helped my baggy eyes. Then of course they go into the whole Spiel just like what you guys are talking about. What's hilarious was I was using my phone and Googling it as she was talking and becoming the best friend I ever had in my whole life you know the whole deal that they do. And she grabbed my phone out of my hand and she said you can't find this online. I said well I just did so I want to know what's the difference between that one I saw on eBay and this one she said those are made in China you see this little Mark on the side and she was pointing to the download app code thing that they have on there. Anyways I told her with a smile on my face you are really good and she's like I'm really good at what? And I'm like at sales. And she about had a kitten. she was like I'm not doing the second half of your face you just have to walk around with one half of your face done and I can't believe I thought you were such a nice person I'm not a salesperson I told you I work in Beverly Hills at the medical place. So I got mad and I said take your damn eye cream back give me my money back and she said sorry all cells are final it says it right there on the receipt and I'm like oh my God you didn't even tell me that. Yeah be careful but like everyone else is saying I really like how it feels I've only been using it for a couple weeks. I'm really glad to hear all the positive things that you guys are saying about it.",

But ya, it\u2019s overly priced. \u2022Love the product- I have seen results, and in my opinion it works. \u2022Don\u2019t like the sales tactic- After doing research, I have a strong feeling the sales person was dishonest to convince me of upgrading from the one light (white ones) to the marvelous 24k Gold black one with all 4 lights. Sales person claimed the black one was more powerful, and penetrated up to seven layers of skin vs the white one only two layers. Conclusion- Cons: 1)I feel so stupid for believing everything I was told. (I trusted this person). I have been getting facials with her for a couple months now. I have yet to confront her with her claims and ask her for more Information about the product. I will give her a chance to prove to me that she was not misleading any information in order to close the sale. 2)I just paid a ridiculous amount of money that I cannot afford. 3) Now that I think about it, I don\u2019t think I really needed the other two colors (green and yellow) I would of been happy with just the two basic light colors that I already had (red and blue). 4)I will need to figure out a way of making a couple hundred extra for the next year to compensate for this investment. Pros: 1) I love the product. It works, I have seen a change for the better on my face when I compare myself with old pictures. Improved under eye area dramatically and wrinkles on my forehead diminished. 2) I see it as an investment in myself. I feel it\u2019s time for me after 41 years of living and giving it all for everyone else. 3) Product has a lifetime warranty. If it stops working I can get a replacement. 4) with my upgrade I\u2019m getting access to expensive creams and facials, which I love. 5) I will need to figure out a way of making a couple hundred extra for the next year to compensate for this investment.",

The parabens concentrations: ethyl paraben (EP), butyl paraben (BP), methyl paraben (MP), and iso-butyl paraben (iBuP) were analyzed in the urine using a validated gas chromatography ion-tap mass spectrometry method. The positive association was found between urinary level of BP and XY18 disomy (p = 0.045) and PP and disomy of chromosome 13 (p = 0.007). This is the first study to examine these relationships, and replication of our findings is needed before the association between parabens concentration in urine and aneuploidy can be fully defined.

You can use the balancing and correcting some nights. Retinols do well with niacinamide but put on carefully. I feel you are lacking a good vitamin c antioxidant in this set. I\u2019d recommend their multi brightening/antioxidant in this. Vitamin c would be in the am and I use their ferrulic over it. Then I\u2019d do a good moisturizer over it both am and pm. The beta glucan one is light for day. At night the phytonutrients is good over retinol. Also, consider doing a double wash. Look at their glycoside products. I use Elta MD over the serums in the am. It sits well under makeup and over products. Anyways, that\u2019s how I would layer what you stated. Hope that helps! You can use chat gpt to help. Also, what are your skin concerns?",

      "I have been an Ordinary supporter for years now, but I have always wondered why they don't have more sunscreen options --considering it's the rule of thumb/queen for long-term skincare. I tried their mineral sunscreen (or what felt like mineral toothpaste) a few years back, absolutely horrible. Never tried it again after I was done with it. I have recently gotten their new one, I like the formula/texture and so far, the usage. That being said, my skin is super dry and not acne prone, so it works out for my skin needs. I wish it came in a more secure and friendly tube to put in my purse. However, the other comments are true too. It can feel greasy for the first few minutes. When I put my glasses on, they don't feel stable. I have been using other sunscreens for the last few years, and found better products on the market for sunscreen. I haven't lost hope on The Ordinary making a sunscreen for body, face, preferences (mineral/chemical), and maybe even tinted?... But yes, their sunscreen game has been confusing. \ud83d\ude12\ud83e\udd14",
      "Lowkey, just my opinion, but BESIDES their wonderful serums, I haven\u2019t had much luck with their other products (cleansers, creams, lip balms, etc). It\u2019s not that these other products are bad, but they just don\u2019t compare as well as with other products such as Cerave, Neutrogena, etc. I personally think that\u2019s why they may not have released a sunscreen. I think they know that they\u2019re mostly best at making serums, as opposed to other products which I personally don\u2019t believe beat other skincare brands\u2014 including sunscreen. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

      "It sounds like you\u2019re not breaking out, but that your skin is showing signs of irritation if you\u2019re seeing breakouts after waxing. Try being more gentle with your skin for at least 24 hours after getting waxed. Harsh products like glycolic acid toner and retinol just irritate skin more and cause irritation bumps that can look like little pimples. I recommend the ordinary soothing barrier and support serum for your after waxing face care routine. My after waxing face care routine: Wash my face with my fingers or soft cotton pad (no hard scrubbing or exfoliation). Then my serums: I put on a few drops of the Ordinary Soothing barrier and Support Serum to help calm the irritated freshly waxed skin, then Niacinamide on the non-waxed areas of my face and my PM moisturizer. The next morning I make sure to do the same routine but with my spf face moisturizer. Then I go back to my normal face routine for bed the next night, unless my skin is still feeling sensitive. The products pictured are good and pretty close to what I use for my normal skin care routine, but way too harsh for the sensitive skin that happens after a fresh wax. If interested I have included my normal face care routine below. Other ordinary products I use: caffeine solution for around my eyes, lactic acid for exfoliating my lips and nose. Normal face care routine: Wash with exfoliating face scrubber. Wait for face to fully dry and then I go in with the glycolic acid toner on an exfoliating cotton pad. Serums are next, caffeine solution, retinol, nicinamide and lactic acid. Then my spf or pm moisturizer and vaseline for my lips. Hope this helps.",
      "The squalene cleanser is good. I use it post wax. Use the glycolic acid no less than 24 but within 48 hours after wax to help prevent ingowns. The day of/morning after a wax, I use just hypochlorous acid spray (let dry) and follow up with squalene oil with moisturizer. I also use the soothing barrier serum. My skin is super sensitive afterward. I always need to wash my face right after a wax. Whatever residue remains always causes a breakout. Nothing harsh for at least 24 hours for me.",

Long story short, go right ahead, the undesired interaction between the two (ie. niacin formation) cannot actually occur in the environment presented by human skin, it actually requires much higher temperatures in order to take place. Just make sure you're not layering too many actives, especially if you're new at it, because it can lead to sensitization, but niacinamide is a very vanilla active that plays well with most ingredients and actually supports your skin's barrier function",

      "While Lauder is on the board of directors, he is not the president of the JNF. He is president of the World Jewish Conference, which is an organization with the goal of protecting Jewish heritage and communities worldwide from discrimination and anti-semitism. Additionally, it\u2019s a bit jumping the gun to say the JNF funds genocide. They are a nonprofit that supports Israel, yes, but you can see where their funding goes with some simple research and see most of what they do is humanitarian aid, education, and heritage site preservation. A very small percentage of the funding goes to supporting the families of Israeli soldiers, and sending food to those soldiers. Remember they have mandatory military service, so not every soldier wants to be serving necessarily. And even if you volunteered and ended up having to serve in such shitty circumstances (like US service members have had to do), you still deserve to have food and water and have your family cared for. Lauder clearly isn\u2019t the most amazing person\u2026like he\u2019s a republican businessman who doesn\u2019t think he needs to pay his fair share, and other things that generally go along with republican views. I however, could not find where his views on Israel and Palastine were so extreme (if anyone has sources on that, I am happy to read them and educate myself!). I, in fact, found things such a as him saying the West Bank territories are \u201clegally disputed but not illegally occupied\u201d which concedes that all have the right to be there. He also has been said to support interfaith efforts as he said that it takes two sides to make peace. He does think Israel should be allowed into NATO. He is an ardent activist for reducing anti-semitism, which is why he is in so many Jewish organizations. As I said above, if anyone has any other information that shows he is funding or supporting genocide, I am happy to read. But being pro-your own community doesn\u2019t really make you pro-genocide IMO.",

Since their Niacinamide is 2% and has propolis it's so good for my dry skin considering I breakout if I use The Ordinary Niacinamide more than 1 drop since I have dry skin.

You can use the balancing and correcting some nights. Retinols do well with niacinamide but put on carefully. I feel you are lacking a good vitamin c antioxidant in this set. I\u2019d recommend their multi brightening/antioxidant in this. Vitamin c would be in the am and I use their ferrulic over it. Then I\u2019d do a good moisturizer over it both am and pm. The beta glucan one is light for day. At night the phytonutrients is good over retinol. Also, consider doing a double wash. Look at their glycoside products. I use Elta MD over the serums in the am. It sits well under makeup and over products. Anyways, that\u2019s how I would layer what you stated. Hope that helps! You can use chat gpt to help. Also, what are your skin concerns?",

      "I have been an Ordinary supporter for years now, but I have always wondered why they don't have more sunscreen options --considering it's the rule of thumb/queen for long-term skincare. I tried their mineral sunscreen (or what felt like mineral toothpaste) a few years back, absolutely horrible. Never tried it again after I was done with it. I have recently gotten their new one, I like the formula/texture and so far, the usage. That being said, my skin is super dry and not acne prone, so it works out for my skin needs. I wish it came in a more secure and friendly tube to put in my purse. However, the other comments are true too. It can feel greasy for the first few minutes. When I put my glasses on, they don't feel stable. I have been using other sunscreens for the last few years, and found better products on the market for sunscreen. I haven't lost hope on The Ordinary making a sunscreen for body, face, preferences (mineral/chemical), and maybe even tinted?... But yes, their sunscreen game has been confusing. \ud83d\ude12\ud83e\udd14",
      "Lowkey, just my opinion, but BESIDES their wonderful serums, I haven\u2019t had much luck with their other products (cleansers, creams, lip balms, etc). It\u2019s not that these other products are bad, but they just don\u2019t compare as well as with other products such as Cerave, Neutrogena, etc. I personally think that\u2019s why they may not have released a sunscreen. I think they know that they\u2019re mostly best at making serums, as opposed to other products which I personally don\u2019t believe beat other skincare brands\u2014 including sunscreen. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

I don\u2019t know where I\u2019d put your niacinamide except an evening when your skin needs more of a break solo. Glycolic should be about 2 x a week. Definitely use a multi brightening serum in the am and do use a moisturizer and sunscreen every day if you use any AHA or BHA or it\u2019s not a good idea. I\u2019d use squalene or Rose hip oil at night. Might think of adding that or only peptides one night. Might be worth diversifying your routine",

      "It sounds like you\u2019re not breaking out, but that your skin is showing signs of irritation if you\u2019re seeing breakouts after waxing. Try being more gentle with your skin for at least 24 hours after getting waxed. Harsh products like glycolic acid toner and retinol just irritate skin more and cause irritation bumps that can look like little pimples. I recommend the ordinary soothing barrier and support serum for your after waxing face care routine. My after waxing face care routine: Wash my face with my fingers or soft cotton pad (no hard scrubbing or exfoliation). Then my serums: I put on a few drops of the Ordinary Soothing barrier and Support Serum to help calm the irritated freshly waxed skin, then Niacinamide on the non-waxed areas of my face and my PM moisturizer. The next morning I make sure to do the same routine but with my spf face moisturizer. Then I go back to my normal face routine for bed the next night, unless my skin is still feeling sensitive. The products pictured are good and pretty close to what I use for my normal skin care routine, but way too harsh for the sensitive skin that happens after a fresh wax. If interested I have included my normal face care routine below. Other ordinary products I use: caffeine solution for around my eyes, lactic acid for exfoliating my lips and nose. Normal face care routine: Wash with exfoliating face scrubber. Wait for face to fully dry and then I go in with the glycolic acid toner on an exfoliating cotton pad. Serums are next, caffeine solution, retinol, nicinamide and lactic acid. Then my spf or pm moisturizer and vaseline for my lips. Hope this helps.",
      "The squalene cleanser is good. I use it post wax. Use the glycolic acid no less than 24 but within 48 hours after wax to help prevent ingowns. The day of/morning after a wax, I use just hypochlorous acid spray (let dry) and follow up with squalene oil with moisturizer. I also use the soothing barrier serum. My skin is super sensitive afterward. I always need to wash my face right after a wax. Whatever residue remains always causes a breakout. Nothing harsh for at least 24 hours for me.",

      "I wonder if it's a person you know? Only cause all you really need to use points in store is an email or a phone number. They dont ask for ID proof of your name or anything. I mean I know friends who order loads of stuff at Sephora and technically I could go in and just give them a phone number and use their points. But, who does that! Also, can you see any of the info of the girl who bought stuff on your account? Like credit card name or anything? edit- I saw earlier in the day a girl on Tik Tok saying a random girl ordered things on Ultra's website using her account points!!! Idk how that works though online... but the girl whose points where stolen got an email showing that her points were used and the name/address the items are being sent too. So, there is proof! Now, if the thief of points was smart she would have picked up the stuff in store so no name proof was disclosed.",

I naturally contacted customer care to inform them of the anomaly and they told me they will escalate the matter to other department and haven\u2019t updated me since.

If you are looking for a similar product I suggest the About Face Fluid Eye Paint or Danessa Myricks Twin Flames Liquid Eyeshadow. DM us so long lasting and vibrant and the colors are stunning. AF is at a lower price point, so the colors seem a bit more muted and not as vibrant but are still very pretty."

They do gels and film forming moisturizers well so i anticipate the transfer resistant claim to be true.

It may be a normal oil and not transfer resistant but if it still remains on the skin versus sliding off it could be a winner.",

      "This is a great question. I bought the Mero F4 brush. Liked it so much I bought another one on the last day of the sale. It\u2019s now my most used brush. I also got the Haus Labs concealer brush and I love it too. And the Patrick Ta blush brush that\u2019s dual ended. I use them all daily. For foundations I tried a few new skin tints. I got the Laura Mercier Naturla Dewy, the MUFE and the Danessa Myricks. I use the first 2 every week but I returned the DM because it\u2019s pulled so bad. I ended up buying another bottle of my Giorgio Armani for full price though because I missed the coverage. Kind of a fail in that category. It\u2019s so expensive! I got the Haus Labs concealer, LM concealer and the Glossier stretch on sale. I hated and returned them all. Ended up buying the T28 and Natasha Denona for full price and love them. I got dew blushes and sunmelt bronzer from Saie. No regrets they\u2019re great. But it did make me want powder blushes to see them with so I bought 3 of the Haus Labs blushes since then for full price. No regrets they\u2019re great. I bought the entire Aestura Atobarrier 365 line. Absolutely love. I got new flavors of SF which I loved then and now. Oh and I tried the Kulfi tubing mascara and it\u2019s fabulous. New favorite. I will absolutely be buying another tube for full price in a month or so when I need another. I plan to buy a few at the next sale. New discoveries since the sale have mostly been fragrances sadly for my wallet. I got Glossier You, Ellis Brooklyn Guava Granita and Vanilla milk and Phlur Heavy Cream. Oh and SDJ 62 and 39 this week! All of the sudden I just needed perfumes lol.",
      "**Bought during the sale:** Sarah Creal concealer - don't like this as a concealer, it creases too bad (and I don't have particularly mature or oily skin). I don't mind it sheered out as a foundation, but it's not any better than my fave foundations and much more $$/ounce when used that way Haus Labs concealer - I didn't own any concealers at all before the sale, so bought two to try. This is better than the Sarah Creal under the eyes, but can look a bit dry after a full day of wear. Still, it's the best concealer I've tried for under the eyes - I've never found one that doesn't either migrate and crease or look a bit dry, no matter how well I prep my skin beforehand. It's not a concealer, but my HG in this category is still the Sisley undereye corrector, but it's $$$$ Westman Atelier powder blush in Sable/Suede - this is nice, but not lifechanging. I like these colors and I like the formula, but the colors aren't particularly unique. Still, I'm happy with this Prada eyeshadow palette in Pansy - this is the first luxury palette I've owned (I also have two from Viseart and one from Danessa Myricks). I like this! The colors and formulas are nice and easy to use. I don't really know how to use this in a cohesive look, but that's more a reflection of my skill level that the palette itself Eadem lip balm in Butter Mochi - hate this so much lol. I bought it as a clear overnight balm to replace my beloved Ole, but this stinks so so bad. Like, I have to hype myself up to use it because I hate the smell so bad. I also hate the applicator - the metal is fine, but it's too wide and is messy to use. I'm hate-using this til it's gone and will then purchase something else **Bought since the sale:** Danessa Myricks Pastel Freedom Palette - this is so, so outside of my usual, boring choices, but I love it so much. I've used it way more than I expected.",
      "Love this question! My purchases: * Replica Afternoon Delight...I love this scent. I don't care that the longevity is trash. It gives me such joy every time I spray it! * Violette FR Bisou Jelly: like this...but I don't reach for it often because it's somewhat drying. When my lips are prepped and hydrated I LOVE this but that's not often. I don't think I'll repurchase. * Sephora Collection Daily Brush Cleaner: this is a staple/repurchase. * The Ordinary Glycolic Acid: staple/repurchase. * Ciele Dual-Ended Sculpt Brush: I LOVE this brush so much. So much that I just purchased the Ciele Dual-Ended Complexion Brush because my IT Cosmetics dual-ended brush sucks. * Saie SuperSuede Powder Blush: I like this...I'm not sure I'd purchase it again. But that might be because I'm inundated with blushes and still want to try others (Rare Beauty powder, Tower 28 powder, MUFE crayon, Dior blush stick, Kosas powder).",
      "Yes omg my current makeup bag holds some stuff from the sale that i love, the ysl candy glaze in #16, my bday gift mario lip liner in rich mauve, kulfi concealer is probably the best i\u2019ve tried in forever. Armani luminous silk and the tower 28 spray i use almost daily.",
      "Haus Labs powder blush in Dragon Fruit Daze. I loved it so much I recently paid full price for the French Rosette shade. Eadem lip balm in Butter Mochi. This is so truly worth the hype for me. I bought another one to keep at my other place and paid full price. I plan to stock up in November or whenever the next sale is. K18 detox shampoo is great. Biossance marine algae eye cream. I'd had a sample of this so I knew what to expect and I really love it. There are other things that I still use and like, but I'm not so sold on them that I wouldn't try something else in the future. Ilia Skin Tint, Milk Makeup setting spray, NARS creamy concealer, Merit cream to powder eyeshadow (I use it as eyeliner), and the Kerastase Gloss Absolu line."

How does this even happen? I ordered again during the sale, and AGAIN my order was missing something. Only 1 item, but of course it had to be the most expensive item. They are shipping me a new one, and did the same thing the first time. However, I have seen horror stories on here where the same thing happens to people and Sephora refuses to reship or reimbursed.

I was never without a coloring book as a child, I've always loved coloring. Trying different shades, different looks is my \"hobby\". If I buy things I don't like, I try to utilize another way, for color in lip/foundation/blush I mix to make a shade I like. I know it's still excessive, but, it's my passion.

There\u2019s countless things that I\u2019ve removed from my wishlist after swatching or smelling them in store \ud83d\ude05. It\u2019s a great way to test formulas and see the nuances in shades that can only be seen in real life.

Her room looked like a tv show set, had the coolest VHS collection, lots of neat, artsy stuff. Then\u2026 I went shopping with her. Not only was she the world\u2019s biggest cheapskate, but she was a professional kleptomaniac. She knew where all the security cameras were and which aisle was safe to smuggle $500 worth of shit. Her and her friends would make fun of me for actually buying stuff. That friendship didn\u2019t last very long. I told her I couldn\u2019t be her friend anymore because she was a huge liability and she should get some help. Release this \u201cfriend\u201d from your life; It\u2019s not the path you want to go down.",

I'll be honest if there wasn't any paper work and if you didn't give your BI i'm sure youre fine. I still say its best to call and make sure before enterting the Sephora so you don't get arrested.",
      "This doesn\u2019t answer your question about your account, but I have some words of wisdom. My best friend growing up would steal from stores all the time. It made me really uncomfortable, but I was very young and didn\u2019t feel it was my place to tell her what to do. Fast forward to when we were 18 and I went on a road trip with her. I was missing a brand new dress I had just purchased on the trip. I looked all over for it, even calling all the stores we were at, and she was there for all of this and helped me look. She went to sleep and I was up still thinking what the heck happened to this dress. I was texting another friend and she suggested I check my friend\u2019s suitcase given her history of theft. I thought it was crazy, there\u2019s no way one of my best friends since I was 6 years old would steal from me, right? Wrong! I found my dress in her suitcase. I confronted her and she played dumb. I never spoke to her again after the trip. Moral of the story is if your friend hasn\u2019t already stolen from you, it\u2019s probably just a matter of time! I\u2019d try to phase her out of my life, definitely don\u2019t go to anymore stores with her, and yeah I probably would try to make a new Sephora account! I\u2019m sorry this happened to you!",

Just talk to her and tell her it wasn\u2019t cool and that you expect she won\u2019t ever do that again when you\u2019re together. If she actually is a good friend, she\u2019ll respond well.

      "I work for a city prosecutor. We don\u2019t have a stand alone Sephora. I see many defendants \u201ctrespassed\u201d from Kohl\u2019s for theft. It\u2019s a signed and recorded document that Kohl\u2019s loss prevention keeps, and a copy is attached to their police department profile. Then, when they go back and are recognized, or caught stealing again, they are charged with criminal trespassing in addition to a new theft if that is what they were caught doing. Even if not stealing, Criminal Trespassing is a jailable offense. If they are on monitored time, the remainder of any suspended sentence imposed by the judge would need to be served.",
      "I was banned for life from Walmart back in high school because my friends sister stole my discount card when I spent the night over her house. The sister then bought a bunch of game consoles with fake or hot checks and used my discount card so my name came up on every transaction. Ridiculous. You\u2019re stealing it why involve me stupid bih. I was fired for not informing them of my lost card. They said I was banned for life but I still go all the time",
      "As everyone said. Be very cautious with this friend. I\u2019m not sure of your age but she appears to be the type to get caught with stolen items and/or illegal items while riding in your car and say she had no idea and let you take the fall. Sucks about the store, but please think about what else she is capable of if her first reaction wasn\u2019t to automatically make sure you weren\u2019t in any trouble for her actions."

That\u2019s why I do take there refund policy seriously, I use a product and use it half way then decide if I want to keep or return it. Then if I decide to keep it, I go online and look for the most valuable place to buy it and/or stock up when it goes on sale. its a rough world out there and with everything becoming so expensive we do have to do whatever can to manipulate the system or it will manipulate us.

Maybe we should all write an email like on the same day asking them to do something about it and then if they're bombarded with emails about it they might decide to do something.

      "The one thing I\u2019m taking away from reading your post and all of these comments is that most of us have had an experience like this and that our \u201cabnormal\u201d bits are actually 100% the norm and it\u2019s oddly comforting. OP, I am so sorry you experienced that. I\u2019ve had my own similar experiences too and I used to get mortified. Even well-meaning people when they comment can be hurtful. I trialed two MUAs for my recent wedding that both asked me about dermaplaning because I have peach fuzz that I don\u2019t shave off because I don\u2019t like how rough the stubble makes my skin feel, and it makes my skin super oily and I get a ton of tiny zits. But yeah, it would make airbrush foundation sit better on my face to not have peach fuzz, even though literally everyone has it to some degree or another. The first MUA was terrible for a lot of reasons and I ended up not booking her but I did try professional dermaplaning thinking it might be different and it wasn\u2019t. My second MUA brought it up more gently but by that point I didn\u2019t care and just flat-out told her I didn\u2019t care and I don\u2019t like how it makes my skin feel or react and just shut that down. I genuinely have stopped caring at this point and if someone tries to make me feel hideous or inferior so I\u2019ll buy a product I am going to laugh in their face. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I have peach fuzz. I have some light acne. I have fine lines under my eyes and around my lips and some sun spots. I\u2019ve got freckles and my eyebrows are too thin. I wear what light makeup makes me feel good and I genuinely don\u2019t give a fig about the rest. Everyone who looks at me is privileged to see my face. \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
      "I would report her. Stuff like this needs to stop. Sales people need to stop preying on insecurities of customers, just in the hopes of getting a sale or an add on sale. Sometimes it's innocent and forgotten, but other times, it can have lasting effects. For instance, 15 years ago, my mother was shopping in the beauty section of Walmart, and a woman came up to her (it's still unclear if they worked for Walmart, or were a random MLM or brand rep) and said, 'you have such a pretty face, but it would be so much prettier if you dealt with your facial hair. I have something that would be amazing for you.' My mom had/has typical midlife blonde peach fuzz (she's super fair skinned), as she was around 55 at the time. She had never once thought of her peach fuzz or cared about it, but from that moment on, it was an obsession. When I got married 10 years ago, it became all about making sure that the foundation used on her was one that didn't accentuate her facial hair, and she even went for her own makeup trial. She bought one of those flawless things, keeps asking me about dermaplaning, tried waxing (had a reaction), and it goes on. 15 years later it is still something that she sees as a flaw when she looks in the mirror - all because someone was trying to sell her something. Sales people need to learn that there are consequences to their actions. Their 'innocent' remarks when trying to upsell can have lasting ramifications to the customer. And just to add, a hydrofacial will not do anything for hormonal acne - hormonal acne generally needs oral medication (been there!), so you are doing the correct thing by working with a doctor (as per your edits). And from your interaction, it sounds like she was looking for any type of upsell (maybe had been getting told off for not enough upsells) and was really grasping, hence why she jumped to brow waxing once you declined the facial. It might have been a case that she saw one spot and rolled with it, trying to get the sale on the facial. I would not read too much into what she said. If you had been feeling good about your skin, I would continue to do so - as someone who suffered with pretty bad hormonal acne when I was younger, I know that we judge the state of our skin the harshest - so if you thought it was looking good, it most likely was. Just try and erase this whole interaction from your mind - after you report her though.",
      "this is ridiculous behavior \u2014 BUT as someone in the beauty industry that struggles with hormonal acne, hydrafacials absolutely DO help. i just prob wouldnt get one from sephora lol. i\u2019m also on 150mg spiralactone (max dosage) along with whole insane regimen of hormonal acne prescriptions. i know your pain sis, you\u2019re not alone if it makes you feel better, i went to my dermatologist yesterday and when she walked in the room she didnt even say hi first, she said \u201coh my god your face has never been worse, sorry, hi! how are you?\u201d(she\u2019s a colleague of my dad\u2019s/family friend and ive been seeing her for years, so this wasnt as rude as it sounds\ud83d\ude02)",
      "I was humbled once as well. Was happily looking at the Glow Recipe counter thinking which one I wanted to test because the smell was amazing when a Sephora employee came to help. I told her I was interested in Glow Recipe which she pointed out that I had mature skin and that was for young people loool needless to say that I left the store and went to buy retinol somewhere else. I\u2019m 36 btw and I never thought I had mature skin or used retinol before that day. So she kind of help me at the end.",
      "My friends and I once went in and I was looking at some stuff for blackhead removal. An employee comes up and my friend starts asking about one of the blackhead products for herself (my blackheads are visible, hers were not) and before she could even ask what her question was regarding the product, the employee just looks at all of us, points right into my face and says: Is this for her? &#x200B; Friend: No, I'm asking for me. If it was for her, why am I asking? The employee said something about like she just saw my blackheads and assumed and she doesn't think my friend has blackheads that were \"that bad.\" The rest of the conversation with the employee was the employee doubling down about how bad my blackheads were and how she was trying to help me and my friend saying: \"That's not the point, the point is \\*I'm\\* the one asking for assistance and not my friend,\" and how what she was doing was unnecessary when she still hasn't even acknowledged my friend as a customer. My friend got fed up with the doubling down that when we finally got the employee to stop trying to sell me products, my friend said she was asking in regards to the blackheads on her asscheeks and not her face and if the employee would still need to see them to answer her yes or no question. This was apparently the final straw with Sephora -- my friend prior had gotten so many condescending remarks from multiple locations before HRT and surgery.) &#x200B; &#x200B; You'd think we would have left without buying something, but our other friend still wanted to redeem her birthday reward so it was an awkward 30-minute wait in that line (for me anyway)."

      "This story absolutely infuriates me. It\u2019s so fucking rude to point out ANYTHING about a person that society sees as a \u201cproblem\u201d or against the dystopian beauty standards we have of hairless, poreless, porcelain aliens walking around. I got married young, and I had a lady at my church try to push Rodan and Fields on me after I announced my engagement. I suffered from hormonal acne due to birth control, not eating well, and just genetics for years. My acne was very visible and no amount of makeup helped. I was very self conscious about it and of course it was at the top of my mind when thinking about my wedding photos and all that. But for her to have the audacity to push her shitty MLM skincare line on me and prey on my insecurities leading up to the most significant event of my life? I was so mortified. Fuck that lady and FUCK this Sephora employee!",
      "NOT that this makes it ok, it doesn\u2019t, but the managers at my store literally train new ppl to read off the camera analysis saying like \u201cit picked up fine lines\u201d or \u201cexcessive oilyness\u201d or whatever and bring up at least two services in each convo. They are literally eavesdropping and talking in our ear like \u201cpromote another thing, ask again\u201d and it\u2019s so annoying but I think some employees are more scared of that pressure so they just do it to appease some of these managers. I agree though that it\u2019s so fucked to comment on anyone\u2019s skin so I never recommend them unless someone asks directly. All that to say, you probably have normal skin and the eyebrow wax comment probably had nothing to do with you, and more to do with the insane metrics and goals that the stores have that they push employees to meet. I\u2019m sorry they made you feel bad leaving the store :(",
      "No advice, but I\u2019m sorry that you experienced that. I was at a dermatologist 20 years ago for acne and it was the worst experience. The medical assistant was like \u201cuse this to wipe off your makeup, don\u2019t worry; it won\u2019t make you break out any worse than you are.\u201d Then the doctor came in and immediately rx\u2019d birth control so I could start accutane. I wanted to talk to him about options and my friend got really depressed on accutane (which is now discontinued). I was like \u201cum, I don\u2019t think I want to take that,\u201d and he was like \"Look, this is unattractive! Take the birth control and dont be like those irresponsible girls who get pregnant on accutane!\" i was shocked and in tears leaving that place. tl/dr: i think people think they can say whatever they want to people when they have acne.",

      "Not Sephora, but at Ulta - I was pregnant at the time restocking on foundation and primer. The salesperson offered to help me and then went on a rant about how the products I chose were super unhealthy (the silicone, specifically) and could potentially harm my unborn baby. I asked her if she was a doctor and she said she wasn\u2019t. I bought my stuff and left. I was so peeved! I don\u2019t go to Ulta for lectures and I\u2019m sure as hell my It Cosmetics primer isn\u2019t going to hurt my unborn child."

Here is one of the few incidents experienced by a customer: [https://community.sephora.com/t5/Customer-Support/Fraud-is-happening-in-my-account/m-p/6801653](https://community.sephora.com/t5/Customer-Support/Fraud-is-happening-in-my-account/m-p/6801653) Their data was breached a few years back in 2019, and a million dollar settlement was paid out in 2022.... so there is a huge concern that sephoras beauty insider accounts are not as secure. Even if you purchase through their app or even have an account through sephora. IF it is a system error, it needs to be corrected. I really hope someone does not have access to your account OR even just in general have access to an account that does not belong to them and is making returns under your information !!.... absolutely a must to report!

If it isn't resolved and you have a favorable amount in a paper trail it can be escalated. If you truly feel like it isn't a system error I sincerely suggest filing with attorney general like everyone else has suggested...not sure what state you're in. I'm not the biggest fan of Sephora's business practices AND am not a big fan of having such a ridiculous report attached to my name, if i was in your shoes.

      "I think as a few others have said you should go to local and national news outlets. You can contact your local news TV news outlet and this is exactly the kind of local interest story that might go national. Contact your local news TV stations \u2013 they often have a consumer-dedicated reporter who deals with fraud and things like this, and helps people get their money back, I know we have a department here at our local news station who does that and does a feature on it every week \u2013 Send tips to major websites, etc. You have all the receipts. If you live in the United States, you can also consider taking them to small claims court. You can take them to small claims court for the items they refused to accept as a return along with damages and for classifying you as a fraud. Yes, you can sue in small claims court for emotional damages plus what you've been through has been classified a fraud and you can represent yourself, it's not scary tell, what you've been through. You've kept track of so much that you have reams of evidence. In order to get them to small claims court, you have to find out who someone called \"the agent of service\" is for the corporation and serve them there. If I had the money, I'd be so mad it wouldn't matter how little the amount, I would go after them for this because the way they've treated you is act really disgusting. I'm so sorry, friend. to find out who the agent of service is, who must be sent the paperwork to notify that they are being sued, you have to contact the consumer affairs department for your state or you can Google it. That's who the documents must be served to. The nice thing about small claims court is that if they don't show up, you get a default judgment. If they do show up, even if they have lawyers, those lawyers won't be allowed to speak IIRC. The nice thing about doing this is that once you get a default judgment, you can do something called a till tap. That's where a sheriffs deputy goes into the nearest Sephora and stands there and literally takes the money from the till. Until your judgment is fully paid. To you. Google it, I had to learn it and navigate all of this when someone screwed my family over after my father's passing. And I've had to go to small claims a few times when my dad was alive on behalf of his business. With persistence, this might be glorious payback for them and maybe would change their policy. Losing $10,000 even if they are a multi billion dollar corporation on one customer because you classified that customer wrongly as a fraud and then if enough people start doing that\u2026 Well, I would email all of this to that email address you have above. All of the above is really easy. The paperwork is minimal. I hope everyone who has had this happen to them sees my comment if they are in the United States and decides to do the same thing. so again, I've done this and it's possible. I am so so sorry this happened to you. You deserved so so so much better. \ud83d\udc9e Forgive me if I missed this in your OP, but you did contact the police and file a report about this? Get a case number from them after you file the report and send them the documentation and the officers badge number and full name.

You can go to the Consumer Affairs department of your state if you live in the United States and also file a complaint there. Also man, I'm not wanting to call the feds but report this to the FBI as cyber crime. Get a case number going there. When you have all these case numbers from the FBI and your local police department, I would email Sephora customer service and tell them that if they won't deal with you, you will be taking them to court, and here are the case numbers from the FBI and your local police department. It's not overkill to do this. You were really screwed over. Even if you never shop there again and I'm so mad that even if I could afford to shop there right now, I wouldn't, on your behalf, but you've been wronged and a victim of fraud.",
      "First I\u2019ll admit I haven\u2019t fully read this so maybe I\u2019m misunderstanding but what I have read makes me feel Sephora is deeply in the wrong and I hope they correct things. Refunds totaling $125k would be CRAZY and I would think stopped way before one person ever got close to making that many returns. I really don\u2019t understand how the person looking into that didn\u2019t also think hey maybe this is an error. If it\u2019s not an error some sort of major con must be going on because that\u2019s so much money. It\u2019s huge felony level stuff if it is some sort of fraud con. Really makes me wonder if a manager or maybe even multiple people are returning things and linking \u201creturns\u201d to random customers but getting cash back or they could maybe used a prepaid card to not link it to anyone but it\u2019s really them doing it and scamming the system. Sephora should really look into it and make sure about all of this. Edit: only other thing I could think is someone stole your identity and scammers out there are stealing and returning loads of items with other peoples identity but Sephora should ask for ID and make sure it\u2019s really that person. Either way there major fraud going on if they really had that many returns, and people working at the store could be involved. You should post your story on social media everywhere, make them pay attention and fix it. Also, they should majorly credit you something for all the trouble and accusing you like that of something you didn\u2019t do.",
      "I echo everyone who says to put them on last on social media, but also send this to/file a report with your state Attorney General's Office and the Office of Consumer Affairs and Protection. My pettiness in this case would know NO LIMITS, tbh. I was so confused as to why you were given a 300 page spreadsheet, that's wild as hell. Also, f that smug twat at Sephora who told you were banned. Hope he also has the year he deserves, what a potato.",
      "This is an absolutely infuriating and bewildering situation. The discrepancies in the report you received\u2014returns happening in multiple states on the same day\u2014make it clear there\u2019s either a major error in Sephora\u2019s data systems or possibly fraudulent activity involving your account details. It could be as simple as a mix-up in their database, where your information is being incorrectly linked to someone else\u2019s returns. Alternatively, there might be some kind of identity theft or unauthorized use of your account that Sephora hasn\u2019t properly investigated or acknowledged. Sephora\u2019s behavior throughout this ordeal\u2014ignoring your case for months, refusing to escalate it properly, and supervisors being dismissive or rude\u2014shows an utter failure of their customer service and internal protocols. For a company that prides itself on customer loyalty and service, this kind of treatment is inexcusable, especially considering your long-standing status as a Rouge member and former employee. What\u2019s even more alarming is that they haven\u2019t taken your detailed proof of inaccuracies seriously. Their unwillingness to investigate fraudulent returns linked to your account raises questions about the integrity of their return monitoring systems. If they\u2019re falsely documenting returns or failing to verify legitimate customer activity, that\u2019s a massive liability for them. It\u2019s also worth considering whether their return policies or systems have grown overly aggressive or automated, flagging customers based on arbitrary thresholds without proper human review. The lack of a warning before your ban and the sheer inconsistency with how other high-return customers are treated suggests that their process isn\u2019t applied evenly or fairly. Filing a complaint with the BBB is a smart move. You might also consider escalating this further by sharing your story on social media platforms like Twitter or Instagram, tagging Sephora directly. Companies tend to respond faster when public attention is on them. You could also look into small claims court if you want to pursue legal action for the damages caused by their negligence.",
      "Ohhh someone who works at Sephora is making a killing using this scam. It's shitty they're putting it on you, OP. I really hope it doesn't come back to bite you in the ass because someone is using your account to make a killing."

      "Okay hear me out - these are the best clips I have ever bought. I got them when they first released and were on good morning America for much lower, and they have the best grip on my hair and literally never fall out. I have very thick, curly, 3A/3B hair and most hair clips fall out or eventually lose their grip in my hair. But these stay on the whole day. They aren\u2019t like the ones you get from target or like Temu. I don\u2019t think they are worth the price though, but if you ever get them on sale or want to treat yourself, definitely try them out. That being said, Crown Affair has been raising their prices this year when they were already pretty costly. I won\u2019t be supporting the brand anymore because of that.",
      "kov essential also sells cellulose acetate hair clips, and can confirm she does not charge this much. Shipping is a bit pricey, but a well made hair clip (mine havent broken in over 2 years of nearly daily use) from a Canadian brand, heck yeah. This brand using \"hand made in france\" truly means nothing to me, because not everything that comes from france has great quality, just like not everything coming from china is shit quality. expensive doesn't equate to luxury.",
      "FYI - it's $54 USD, which def doesn't make it any better, but people like to run wild with these stories so figured I'd include US price as well (see: Patrick Ta's Foundation fiasco). That said, I hope people realize that Sephora does not make up these prices and it's on the brand... These clips are cute, but not $54 cute and I'm not sure why the cost is so high as the brand website just says that they're \"handcrafted in France.\" I don't know why people are surprised that Sephora would carry such a brand because at the end of the day they're not trying to be like Ulta lol... And that's not a dig at Ulta because I shop there as well, but the demographics are different. Take a look at other luxury designer sites and you'd probably end up with a heart attack... it's ridiculous but there's clearly a market for it. Anyways, I'm gonna need a review from a real person that wasn't gifted this product to give us the real tea. Sometimes things priced like this is insane, but could be worth it in the long run. Like I would rather drop $100 for a t-shirt that fits my figure and lasts years down the line, versus a $10 t-shirt from H&M that I'd need to replace after the first few washes cause it lost its shape.",
      "I bought these from the brand a number of years ago (maybe 5 years?) when they were less expensive but still very expensive (to me) for clips. I used their bundle deal they run around Black Friday IIRC so it was a little less expensive. Unfortunately, these are the best clips I\u2019ve ever used. I have long, thick hair and I am using one as I type this gto keep my hair out of my face. I use one probably 6 days a week. I even bought another set on deal because i didn\u2019t want to lose them and be without. I haven\u2019t lost one (I probably keep track of them more than less costly ones). They do such a great job of holding my hair in place. That said, it\u2019s a personal decision of what you want to spend and the price listed is really up there. But I will say these are actually better than I\u2019d hoped. My other go-to: Teleties."

I went full Karen mode. Demanded to speak to a manager,and demanded an apology. Pointed out how utterly outrageous it was to accuse me of such a thing. I\u2019d been a rouge member for years at that point. There is no excuse for this kind of behaviour. I\u2019m getting ing angry just thinking about it. They need to think of the harm created by making such an accusation to a loyal customer, vs letting someone know they think you stole something even when it can\u2019t be proven.",

Sales people ask if he needs help and that\u2019s it, he\u2019s left alone. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s partly because of his race, partly to do with his gender. I think people are just more okay with making women feel uncomfortable or intimidated, even other women, and they turn it up a notch for brown people. It\u2019s gross. Then people switch to shopping online and if you get the wrong order or only half of your order they call it an \u201caccommodation\u201d to send you what you paid for. All of it is annoying to me.",

      "Looks like the brushes are fude (handmade in Kumano, Japan by master brush makers) and these kinds of brushes can get pretty expensive. That being said, the price for this set is absolutely ridiculous, especially considering that they have synthetic bristles. Not sure who the OEM is but it is likely one of the bigger brush brands like Chikuhodo, Hakuhodo, or Koyudo. Either way, you can get much better quality brushes for much less than what Westman Atelier is charging. ETA: if anyone is interested in these brush shapes, feel free to ask me here or ask on the 2 fude subreddits for recommendations. There are much better and less expensive options from other brands",

If you can get me, a sucker for nice things, to look at this and think it\u2019s ridiculous and it makes me think less of her brand, then she is in trouble. I feel like she did better when she was exclusive in Barney\u2019s (obviously can\u2019t be anymore), and had a smaller, curated line of products. I was at first happy to see her in Sephora, but I don\u2019t know if it is her brand that is getting greedy, or being in the Sephora LVMH machine, but I am not sure if being this ridiculous will do her any good. I could get these brushes, but I don\u2019t like getting ripped off to my face. First the $590 tiny traincase\u2026then things like this. It makes me sideeye all my purchases from the brand.

The bristles are very soft and using the blender brush with their highlighters are making application easy and fast but i can use some of my existing brush for that Overall the quality is good and really reminded me of the rae morris brushes which is also synthetic and made in japan and overpriced. Honestly i rather get a natural hair brushes",

Also, the applicator is incredibly short, so after just a couple uses it didn\u2019t reach the product, so I had to spray a couple drops of setting spray to shake inside and then drop onto my finger to apply. If you are looking for a similar product I suggest the About Face Fluid Eye Paint or Danessa Myricks Twin Flames Liquid Eyeshadow. DM us so long lasting and vibrant and the colors are stunning. AF is at a lower price point, so the colors seem a bit more muted and not as vibrant but are still very pretty."

      "I would recommend using something like retinol for anti-aging (and using serums with ingredients like lactic acid or the DDG peel pads) and then a moisturizer that hydrates, has peptides, and possibly helps firm. The Tatcha overnight indigo cream and their dewy creams are great. I know people on this thread hate on Drunk Elephant but their protini moisturizer with peptides is great for my skin too. Innbeauty\u2019s extreme cream is pretty good for a lower price point. I was surprised I liked it as much as I did"
