    "selftext": "The first two pictures were taken in 2020, and the last two were taken today. Before I started taking Accutane around 2021, my skin type was very oily. However, ever since the end of my treatment, my skin type has become mixed. My main skin concerns were hormonal acne, and I\u2019m currently trying to treat acne scars and discoloration/hyperpigmentation with vitamins and vitamin C masks.\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve used many skin products, but many of them messed up my skin instead of improving it. Here are some skin care products that either improved my skin or helped maintain its health:\n\n1. - [AM & PM] CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser: I\u2019ve been using this face cleanser for the past three years. Although I don\u2019t wash my face every day (I struggle with sticking to habits), I\u2019ve never gotten a bad reaction from it. It\u2019s affordable and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and clean.\n2. - [PM] Innisfree Green Tea Seed Hyaluronic Cream: I started using this moisturizer around a year and a half ago as my primary moisturizer. Although it\u2019s expensive ($40 for 50ml), it\u2019s the only moisturizer that dries quickly, leaves no residue, doesn\u2019t feel heavy or sticky on my face, and leaves my skin glowing the day after! I\u2019m currently looking for a cheaper alternative.\n3. - [3x/week] Gleamin Vitamin C Clay Mask for Dark Spots: I got this as a gift a while ago and have been using it every other day. I make sure to moisturize my skin after using it. I use it mainly for its dark spot-minimizing effects, which have been slightly working this far!\n\nIn addition to these skin care products, I\u2019ve also done a lot of not skin care-related things, including:\n\n* Hormonal treatments (birth control) for my stubborn acne (2020-2021)\n* Aggressive rounds of Accutane for roughly six months (2021)\n* Weight loss surgery that helped regulate my hormone levels and overall health (2022)\n* Acne scar treatments (five sessions of micro needling and PRP) (2024-2025)\n* Daily prenatal vitamins\n* - Silk pillows! Highly recommend\n\n",

However, there are several risks and I'd like to warn you about them: * You should not be doing this every day. When done in-office, treatments are spaced a few weeks to a month apart. * Done improperly you can end up with hypopigmentation (white or colorless spots in the skin that do not return to a normal color) * It hurts. * You can not fully sterilize the needles at home. They can be sanitized at best. * The needles can become bent over time, or come from the manufacturer already bent. Small bends can be imperceptible to the naked eye and can cause unwanted damage to your skin. **Because of these risks, ScA does not recommend attempting dermarolling or dermastamping at home. Please be careful with your skin and your health!** *If you see that I am replying to something out of context (eg. listed in a routine), please report this comment so my handlers can remove it.

    "title": "[Personal] Some ADHD/executive function/depression skincare tips. Mostly about how to not loathe washing your face.",
    "selftext": "I never had acne growing up, but it hit me at 30 and I hate it. The hardest part for me has been getting into the habit of washing my face. It\u2019s always felt unpleasant from a sensory standpoint, but I\u2019ve made some progress lately, and here\u2019s what\u2019s helped!!\n\n**Not hating face washing is mostly about managing water**\n\n* Use a lot of washcloths. Like...a luxurious number of washcloths. I often use TWO per session: one to clean/rinse my face, and one to dry my hands at intervals. Since I hang my wet rags to dry on the sink, I often use the one from the night/morning before as my hand drying towel (and use a fresh one for my face obviously)\n* To manage my increased washcloth usage, I keep two cheap [ikea bins](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/ranen-basket-00527078/) under my sink: one for clean, one for dirty. This way I don't have to fold anything, just dump the clean washcloths in the bin. I hang the damp ones over the faucet overnight to dry. Another pro tip is to use the used washcloth to wipe down the counter afterward.\n* You can also get those wrist guard things that stop water from running down your arms. I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d matter, but they made a huge difference. I actually wash my face now. I keep two sets so there\u2019s always a dry pair available for morning and night. I use this and the washcloth thing together.\n* Also: if your face wash is inexpensive, get a second one to keep in your shower.\n\n**Time is fake**\n\n* If you're testing new products, track it. I thought I\u2019d been using a benzoyl peroxide wash for six weeks......it had only been two. Now I mark the start date and add a check-in 4-6 weeks later in my calendar so I don\u2019t give up too early.\n* A timer or bathroom clock helps for wait times between steps too. I want to try and wait ten minutes after my moisturizer before applying sunscreen, or leave a hair mask on for ten minutes, or brush my teeth for two minutes, etc. I like a physical timer that just stays there because it solves the 'oh dang my phone's across the room' problem.\n* If you're rotating actives, write a schedule on a post-it. Make the schedule fixed to an objective marker (\u201cretinol = Wednesday,\u201d) and not a relative one (\u201cretinol every 3 days\u201d). I accidentally over exfoliated once because I can't remember anything at any point ever\n\n**Random other stuff**\n\n* Use micellar water, not makeup wipes.\n* Keep a cup in the bathroom as a visual cue to drink water.\n* Get [clear shelves](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/melloesa-picture-ledge-transparent-60446239/) so you can see your products, they\u2019re easier to use that way. I have two: one for morning, one for night routine.\n* If picking is an issue, throw out your tweezers. Even if you think you'll cave and re-buy them, it's okay to still try.\n\nGood luck have fun!",

    "selftext": "I\u2019m 20M. About 1.5 years ago, I had clear skin. Barely any acne. I wasn\u2019t even doing anything special. Literally\u00a0*nothing*. No products, no routine. Just vibes.\n\nThen I got into gua sha. It was fine at first \u2014 felt kinda nice, relaxing, whatever. But then I used\u00a0*argan oil*\u00a0with it, and things started to go downhill. I broke out \u2014 mostly around the sides of my throat and cheeks, basically where I was doing gua sha. I didn\u2019t think much of it and kept going, and honestly I think I just made it worse by inflaming/popping stuff unknowingly.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve been stuck in this weird cycle of acne. I started trying actual skincare, thinking it would help \u2014 moisturizers, different routines, etc. But nothing seems to help. In fact, sometimes it feels like the more I try to fix it, the worse it gets.\n\nI have this suspicion that moisturizers (even gel-type ones like that red bean one from Beauty of Joseon) are making it worse. I\u2019ve tried using them off and on, and every time, I\u00a0*feel*\u00a0like more acne shows up. But idk \u2014 maybe it\u2019s just in my head?\n\nI tried dermatologists and it was the worst money I've spend in years. They were just advertising their plan and were giving advice in general\n\nMy sister says it\u2019s probably just hormones and \u201cit\u2019s normal for guys at your age.\u201d But idk man\u2026 I can\u2019t shake the feeling that my skin was better\u00a0*before*\u00a0I started trying to care for it. Like, should I just stop doing skincare altogether? Just use a gentle cleanser and nothing else?\n\nIt\u2019s super frustrating because it feels like the more I care, the more I suffer. Anyone been through something similar? What helped you? Should I just go full caveman mode again?",

Honestly most people don't need some 5 step routine in their life, some honestly do, but don't fall for that dumb \"ClEaN bEaUtY\" crap. Just buy stuff that's for sensitive skin, non-comedogenic, check if it's eczema approved, etc I think the best routines for most people are just pH Balanced Gentle Cleanser (once a day is usually all you need, make up usage may mean a double cleanse, oily skin AS DIAGNOSED BY A DERMATOLOGIST not your algorithm may need a morning and night) something simple like Cetaphil sensitive skin cleanser is great. Then If you want something targeted, Serum as your ONLY active but this is optional (Panthenol in a serum is nice and calming though). The a good moisturizer (Ceramides, Cica, Glutathione, these are all good skin repairing and calming ingredients that should help settle skin down) DONT Buy lotions that are \"Daily use\" with AHAs/BHA's or Retinol in it unless a Derm has said you should OR you discuss with one how to use retinol appropriately for your skin as these will literally fuck.thay skin barrier right up of used every day. Last but not least getting sunscreen that you like and it is actually the SPF it states and to use a daily in the appropriate quantities of needed. I like the Derma be SPF 50 PA+++++ because it feels like a light lotion and it's not oily, it's a combination of chemical and mineral sunscreen. At the end of the day though get whatever one you will use everyday because you'll like the way it feels, but that's laundry doesn't matter if you're not going to put it on cuz you don't like the texture of it *Cough* La Roche Posay Anthelios *Cough* So just scale back and keep it to the basics and what's been proven time and time again in the medical literature through decades of research, experimentation, in vitro and in vivo studies and avoid any trendy buzzy skincare and that's it folks. That's what like 90% of people need. If that isn't working, consult a Derm not a for you page.",

I drink smoothies made of fruits and Greek yogurt once a day. And eat plenty of healthy nuts.\n\nA year ago, I was using CerVa Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser with Clindamycin, Tretinoin, and CerVa Moisturizing Cream. This worked for a bit, but still had very oily skin.\n\nI switched to just using BYOMA moisturizing gel with little results in my oily skin.\n\nI recently switched to only Neutrogena Fragrance Free Facial Cleanser with Netrogena Oil-Free Moisturizer with SA.

Higher percentages lf tretinoin control oil better, so you could go back to tretinoin and increase strength. Salicylic acid is another option, but not as solid as tretinoin. Niacinamide at 10% is really good for oil control as well (only if you can tolerate it though). That\u2018s pretty much it for very effective topical treatments. If you\u2018re really at your wit\u2018s end, accutane significantly reduces oil production, so look into it. Microdosing could work for you especially since you only have very mild acne",

I had been using it at night only but yesterday I used it during the day too. I had been trying to use spf on my cheeks but chemical ones burn and mineral ones are too heavy. Both end up causing flares due to irritation (filters in chemical ones, occlusion from mineral ones trap heat). \n\n**My routine** that I do during and after flareups is just a water rinse in the am + vanicream (tub version). Then at night I use vanicream cleanser and the same moisturizer. \n\nHowever during some flareups I\u2019ve had success with just using cicaplast. Other times it seems to make it worse\u2026so I really am at a loss. ",

For my routine I\u2019ve kept it pretty simple: AM Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser Cetaphil Daily Facial Mosturizer with SPF PM Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser Thayers Lavender Witch Hazel Cetaphil Daily Facial Mosturizer with SPF Edit : Wow I just want to thank everyone for their really kind words. I really appreciate all the support and the positivity being spread around, it\u2019s such an amazing feeling to be happy with your own skin again!! I\u2019ve been having problems with acne for about 5 years now, and for anyone asking or worrying about accutane, I personally wish I\u2019d started it sooner. Of course, I\u2019m not an expert and you should definitely talk with a dermatologist about the drug, but in my case it was really worth it! To just be able to go to the grocery store without any makeup on and not worry about people looking at you is a feeling I haven\u2019t had in a while. I\u2019m extremely thankful that I was able to feel so confident in my dress, standing with my beautiful friends as we went to our graduation banquet last night. It was an amazing experience, and I\u2019m just happy that high school is coming to an end! So again, thank you to everyone for the congratulations, I\u2019m glad to have shared some of my experience with anyone else going through the same thing right now.",

I have naturally dry skin and I'm on tretinoin so the lanolin makes a big difference for me. My favorite way to use it is to apply something thin and moisturizing underneath (when I finish my face moisturizer I cut it open and let it dry out a bit and use this as it has grapeseed oil or I use the Aven\u00e9 lip butter) then apply the lanolin on top as a protective layer. It protects like vasaline would but better and it also moisturizes so it's amazing. I also like to use it to make my own homemade lip balms (I add marula oil, borage seed oil, and mix in some of the Nivea lip butter and even a bit of Nuxe Reve de miel). Seriously give it a try! :) Also congrats you look really lovely and I bet you feel great too! :)",

If it hadn't been such a Holly Grail for me I'd think it was weird or gross but it's the only thing that's worked for my super dry lips and when your lips are as dry as mine were (especially back when I was playing clarinet and saxophone) you'll do almost anything to get proper long term relief from dryness. The lanolin is thick enough that it will stay put while I'm sleeping and it's actually still there when I wake up and it's the only product that has done that for me.",

I believe the biggest proven danger is to unborn children which is why patients need to be so careful to avoid getting pregnant (and why you can't donate blood while on Accutane). You know what's a dangerous drug? [Tylenol](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/tylenol-overdose_n_3976991), many times over. Yet no one really seems too concerned about it which is odd.",

This is the full routine with added products below Work time: Vaseline but sparingly because you have to work. Maybe even Vaseline when you put gloves on and liberally applied throughout the day and definitely after washing. Before sleep: Cover all knuckles and finger tips with a high quality chapstick. You want to think of thick moisturizers like beeswax, Shea butter, cocoa butter. I suggest Burt\u2019s Bees Overnight Lip Treatment. Then cover in Vaseline. Use a sock or cotton gloves and sleep. After cracks are healed, continue using chapstick and add in O\u2019Keefe\u2019s but the key is to apply when your hands are still wet. It sounds weird but it works. Then apply Vaseline on top when you sleep. **Bonus: You could start taking Flax Seed Oil supplements. It\u2019s been clinically proven to not only help moisturize your eyes but also skin. Notably elbows, feet, and hands. You have to work up to 3000 mg a day but it literally helps so much. We live in a desert and I have chronic dry eyes and it has helped me so much. I\u2019ve also noticed my feet don\u2019t crack anymore. Let me know if you have questions! Stay safe and be careful out there",

Didn\u2019t actually have a routine, but just having something to learn about and focus on, and keeping little lists of imaginary routines helped a lot (actually, this is lame, but using Urstyle which is like Polyvore so I could visualise the routine helped a lot - curbs the urge to buy, buy, buy because for me it mimics the novelty of opening up a shiny new bottle). I still actually use that to plan routines and new purchases. Once I started taking care of my skin it was helpful to have just *some* semblance of routine in my life, something I did twice a day every day at roughly the same time. Sometimes just once was fine, but it was something. I\u2019m an obsessive person and really methodical, so all the research really sated me because I was disinterested in pretty much everything else at the time. It was almost like a perfect depression hobby; time intensive but low effort. The only problem is that if it\u2019s all you\u2019ve got going on for you because you\u2019re at your rock bottom, you can quickly become too results oriented and almost a little dysmorphic. Framing it as self care is helpful, but it\u2019s only self care if it\u2019s accompanied by positive self talk and not driven solely by trying to address a negative (easier said than done if you have serious skin concerns, but important nonetheless). Don\u2019t get all Silicon Valley self optimisation on yourself and you\u2019re alright.",

Unless you have a sensitivity to hyaluronic acid (which despite the scary word acid is a humectant not an exfoliant!) there's not much else in it that might be irritating- no alcohol or oil or fragrance. It's very watery but in a good way and I find it to be soothing since it helps my skin retain moisture. It's a moisturizing toner- I put it on my skin while it's still damp and before moisturizer. I like both the regular and premium versions- premium is a bit thicker and more slippery but they both absorb well.",

Along with that, I stopped washing my face every morning and night and toned it down to maybe once or twice every 3 days with the cosrx salicylic acid cleanser. Other days I would just splash water on my face. I also began using 2.5% benzoyl peroxide gel before bed and vitamin c serum in the morning to help with some of the hyperpigmentation. If I had to guess, it was the vitamin B5 that contributed the most, after a few days of taking 5-7g of it I noticed my skin being a lot less oily, especially in the morning. I cannot guarantee that my simple routine may work for everyone, especially megadosing vitamin b5 as it has varied results - some say it works just as well as accutane and others say it made their acne worse. If you\u2019re taking this into consideration for you or someone else please do some deep research as there are also some mild risks associated. Thank you for the kind comments \u2764\ufe0f",

I don't know if it's solely B5 effects that you see, it's hard to say for sure unless topicals are introduced in separate steps. Why I'm saying this - Benzoyl Peroxide is a very potent bactericide, so it might have contributed if acne and inflammation were caused by bacteria. It's also drying so might have helped with feeling of oiliness in the morning. So if you'll experiment with different actives in the future, I would suggest removing and adding them separately to see how much they influence your skin, and wait a week or two.",

Well, ultimately I have a hormone imbalance which I assumed since that\u2019s what I\u2019ve found is typically a good guess for random acne that does not seem to go away. I had very average manageable acne before and barely any scarring but around turning 18 it freaked out. (Most likely from the stress and anxiety that increased around a year ago. Not sure if hormone imbalances came first or life that caused them haha. But That\u2019s when my acne really picked up. But, it all makes sense now. The test basically told me my cortisol levels were low during the day and spiked at night. (Explains depressive mood in the day and my anxiety attacks or breakdowns I\u2019d often have before bed.) But, More importantly I have higher than average levels of DHEA. This DHEA stuff apprently can wreak havoc. Anxiety, paranoia, depression, irritably and, you guessed it it totally triggers acne. The test also tested neurotransmitters and mine are fine and within normal range. Goes to show how the hormones have actually effected me in ways I\u2019d never imagine. As well as slightly higher levels of a strong androgen I\u2019m producing... hormones suck to aay the least. They can be so sneaky. As a side note, I\u2019d highly recommend that test if anyone has some hormonal suspicions or is maybe looking for some answers on mental health or physical conditions. It can tell you a lot. It\u2019s called the DUTCH test if anyone is interested and thinks the money could be worth it. I wish I\u2019d done it sooner. Anyways, the naturopathic/endocrinologist doc I went to made me a tincture and gave me a couple of supplements to start taking. Maybe I\u2019ll make an update in the future. In time they should help balance out the issue. The goal is to help my body fix/regulate itself to begin with rather than just blast the acne off with drugs and not question why it\u2019s there only for it to come back haha. I\u2019ve grown up on this kind of medicine at my grandpas clinic as well. Accutane has been a miracle worker to help me in the meantime and given me some time to fix the real issues. If all goes well, this will help or hopefully balance me out and prevent the acne from coming back once I finish accutane.",

My dermatologist recommended this over 10 years ago, and it continues to be my go-to when I don\u2019t want/need a face wash with actives in it. THIS WOULD BE GOOD FOR GETTING RID OF EXTRA FACIAL OILS WITHOUT STRIPPING IT OF TOO MANY. It absolutely helped to clear up acne I had back when I started using it, more so than any salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide wash. And like I recommended above, adding something with kojic acid or alpha arbutin in it will help to clear up any skin discoloring left behind from old acne marks. I recently stopped using alpha arbutin for several weeks (because of an unrelated skin allergy) & noticed red marks left behind from the simplest clogged pores. Within 7 days of restarting the arbutin, roughly 70% of the darkness was gone; within another week or two, 95% of it is gone (of course I see the remaining 5%, but others probably don\u2019t notice it\ud83d\ude0f). Just an idea....you\u2019re doing so well already, that I\u2019d love to see u 100% \u201ccured\u201d when all is said & done :) ;) :) ;)",

I have just one recommendation (maybe 2) for when you\u2019re left with discolorations on your skin after the acne itself has healed: The Ordinary brand has Alpha Arbutin Serum which has fixed all of my discoloring issues. It\u2019s amazing, and with consist use, I think you could end up with skin showing no evidence of past acne. I LOVE THIS STUFF AND KEEP REPURCHASING IT SO IM NEVER WITHOUT. Another option which has also helped my skin, which may be an even better recommendation than the last, is Urban Rx Skin Clearing bar. It has sulfur, salicylic acid, and kojic acid in it. The first 2 ingredients will continue to fight off acne, and the 3rd (kojic acid) will attack the discoloration issues. I LOVE THIS STUFF AS WELL, & IT LASTS A REALLY LONG TIME! Other than that, it\u2019s clear you have everything else under control. KUDOS TO YOU, & BEST WISHES MOVING FORWARD:)",

I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s coming from within the body which derms don\u2019t tell you... lol. Instead they prescribe many topical chemical things, like a bandaid fix. I stopped using any super chemical-y cleansers / moisturizers and used an exfoliating brush to wash my skin. Personally for me I find regular cerave/neutrogena/cetaphil, etc. to strip my skin and do more harm than good. Neutrogena naturals was good though. I currently use an oil based cleanser by Desert Essence that completely *transformed* my skin. Tretinoin is great! Especially in the areas with acne. I suffered for years, and I hope this can be of help.",

The only thing i would suggest is to use a face wash daily instead of a few times per week, just at night, and keep using only water in the mornings. And add a gentle moisturizer and broad or full spectrum sunscreen OR a moisturizer/sunscreen combo product. You'll see less hyperpigmentation from past/healing breakouts with sun protection. Since your serum contains retinol your skin really needs sun protection.",

I'm not sure if you want any product recommendations, but you could look into Differin gel if you're willing to try something new. It worked absolute miracles on my skin, and now my skin is basically blemish-free and glowy for the first time in years! It's $12 on Amazon, I mostly use it as a sort of spot treatment on my acne, and I would recommend keeping it away from your eye area if you have sensitive skin. Besides that, it's just great. Maybe give it a try, if you want.",

        "body": "I think Tretinoin/Retin-A would do wonders for you! It works on both active acne, and on the hyperpigmentation and scars that old acne left behind over time. It's prescription only, but it's easy to get by just asking your general doctor or dermatologist (at the very least, they're still doing telehealth visits, and they should start doing in-person visits again), or even a minute clinic at a CVS or similar. CVS is doing free delivery on prescription meds right now too. There's also online services like Apostrophe and Curology where you fill out a questionnaire and send in pics of your skin. There's also Adapalene/Differin that gets compared to Tretinoin a lot, is over-the-counter, and has less side effects, but it seems like it'll help with scarring less. If getting tret is too inconvenient, I'd consider opting for Adapalene. If you do opt to get a retinoid like the two I mentioned, you'd probably have to drop the retinol serum you were using just to simplify your routine. Come to think of it, Curology or Apostrophe could be a really solid option for you, because they can include Tretinoin as well as antibacterial ingredients into your formula like clindamycin and azelaic acid, which would do the job of benzyl peroxide, so you could simply your routine further. You'd have to ask for it directly, or they'll stick you with some milder formula like they did with me. It's certainly worth considering! :)",

As far as feeling like cardboard, they\u2019re very crisp when fresh and clean. With our mattress it stays taught and crisp better than any other sheets we\u2019ve tried. Sateen and polyester sheets are terrible. If you have dry skin, it feels like it snags the sheets, and they stick to you. Silk are probably the best, but I\u2019ve never tried it.

The way I see it is that your kidneys want to flush out the toxins, and if there isn\u2019t enough water coming in, it steals it from wherever it is less important. Kidneys > skin. So water intake is helpful. I\u2019ve also done some rudimentary tests to see if it increasing my water intake (to balance alcohol intake) helps keep my skin from drying out, and yes, it helps. With grains, I don\u2019t know if water helps keep my skin dry, it seems that it\u2019s something in the grains themselves, maybe toxins or something that is causing it. As far as the 8 glasses of water a day thing, that\u2019s actual a made up number and as far as I know has no research behind it. At least it was an arbitrary number when it they first started to recommend it.",

To be fair it's not really something that needs to be designed with sterility in mind, it's designed to be comfortable enough to get people to use their CPAP regularly. There are, of course, good hygiene and maintenance practices for them. Masks are usually replaced every anywhere 1-3 months depending on wear and whether or not there is a separate cushion. On the kind I use, the cushion (the memory foam) piece isn't replaceable, so I just switch the full mask out every month or so. But thatt's still not enough to keep me from getting weird breakouts. Idk I'm still new to using a CPAP so I may be able to switch to something easier once I've fully adjusted, but for now you can pry the comfort of memory foam from my dead, sleep deprived hands",

Don't be rude** Because we'd like this sub to be a friendly and welcoming place, we are a bit more strict with what users are allowed to say than you might be used to. We don't allow rudeness of any kind, so please try to remain kind and respectful when interacting with others. - **2. Don't be inappropriate** We'd like our users to feel comfortable sharing their images without getting hit on or judged. They\u2019re here to talk about their skin, not about their general looks or attractiveness. Complimenting OP on their skin is fine, but commenting on other aspects of their appearance, or making sexualized comments, no matter how well-intentioned, is considered inappropriate in this sub. - **Please be mindful of this when commenting in this sub.

Edit to add that I don't feel like I suddenly have any extra, magical self esteem or anything. I still need to learn how to accept the aspects about my appearance that make me feel less than confident, like my acne scars and under eye circles... However, going makeup free makes me focus more on the part of me that is smart, funny, good at my job, etc. It makes me feel more human.",

        "body": "pretty bummed because i was having the clearest skin of my life before! right now i\u2019m: - washing with soap and water - using Aquaphor healing ointment - dressing it (but i heard it\u2019s good to leave it open and dry? not sure) ive ordered some silicon bandaids, but that\u2019s about it. also i have no clue what to do with skincare now! i used to use cerave cleanser, azealic acid, and cerave PM moisturizer. i guess that should be hold for now? update: thanks for the outpouring of support you guys!! i scheduled an appointment with a doctor, i know most of you folks are recommending i go to a derm (which i will do later) but i realize i should get my entire body, and face checked out. (and a tetanus shot...) this is my first time seriously trying to care for a wound, normally i shrug it off... but damn, i\u2019m really sad i busted my face that i worked so hard to have nice skin. right now i am doing (as per some of your advice) - keeping it very clean, gently soap and water - aquaphor! a layer of it... but yes, lots of aquaphor - NOT dressing it, gauze kept sticking and it was a pain (literally) to take off - ive ordered some silicon bandages and will use aquaphor before applying (is that right?) - when it heals some, apply vitamin e and hella sunscreen - oh yes, avoid the sun at all costs. sm sunscreen let me know if this sounds right? of course i\u2019ll get proper advice when i visit a derm, but i\u2019m working on that right now. (gonna see one in a week!) currently gotta make sure i didn\u2019t fuck up anything... worse!! right now just hoping my 22 yo body is still youthful enough to heal fast! update 2: quick Q, how do i wash off the Aquaphor? am i supposed to wash it off? or just reapply it whenever the current layer seems thin? I tried washing it off with gentle soap yesterday, but man, that stuff is so hard to get off. I kinda gave up and just applied a new layer on top. also\u2014 many people here have recommended hydrocolloid bandages. when i use those, does that still need a layer of Aquaphor underneath? or can i just put it on clean bare skin? update 3: here\u2019s some drawings i made to cope https://imgur.com/a/vSPPdGP/",

            "body": "Edit: this has gotten a lot of attention so I want to clarify that the technique below is designed for the face specifically to get the best cosmetic result. I don\u2019t recommend bandaging. However, for minor scrapes on the body I apply aquaphor until it heals and only put a band aid on top of that as a protective covering to prevent clothes from rubbing against it as needed (work, outings). Bandages should be removed regularly for a few hours to avoid maceration. Whatever bandage you use for your scrapes, do not allow the adhesive part to stick to your open wound. \u2014\u2014\u2014- Hi! My husband is a dermatologist, and highly highly recommend the following. I also did this after doing fractionated CO2 on my face recently, and was recommended to do this by the dermatologist. For the first week, always always always keep it covered with a thin layer of aquaphor (I did this for ~9-10 days based on how my skin was feeling. If it\u2019s still very dry at d7, keep going with thin aquaphor). At night, you can use a triple antibiotic ointment (like neosporin) until the epithelium has healed. Your wounds will likely ooze, this is normal. You can pat off the ooze with a clean tissue as needed but keep it covered with aquaphor. Wash off the aquaphor gently with water in the morning and night. For the first week or so, you do not need to use anything but aquaphor, neosporin, and water for your face. Do not use anything with fragrance, or any face wash during this time until there is new epithelium. Do not dress it, but a few times a day (4-5) you can do a cold vinegar soak (1 tablespoon dilstilled white vinegar in 1 quart of distilled purified water) by soaking gauze and leaving it on your face for 5-10 minutes. Rinse off with cold water, reapply aquaphor. Also helps with itching! Edit: always wash your hands before doing any of these steps! -Also, if you get any acne with neosporin or triple antibiotic ointment, back off of it and go back to just aquaphor. And please use aquaphor jn tube, not the giant tub! -you do not want to see any scabbing! Scabbing will increase severity of scarring. This is why you always keep it covered with aquaphor. Adding bandages on top will soak up the ooze and cause tearing when you try to remove them. Please avoid this! I cannot stess this enough - a thin layer of aquaphor is enough to protect the skin from pathogens, as well as keep it moist. Just reapply, reapply, reapply! After about a week, the skin should have grown back (it will be very pink). You can start using gentle facial cleansers (cerave, cetaphil) and a gentle moisturizer (cerave pm is fine, no acids!). Do not use any actives. For the next month (and always!) apply a layer of chemical sunscreen, then a layer of mineral sunscreen that works for your face. Keep out of the sun, as this period is risky for developing PIH.",

They typically continue to provide protection until they're rubbed or washed off. Usually, chemical sunscreens have a better texture and are more water proof. While physical sunscreens can be thicker and are sometimes visible on certain skin colours. But physical sunscreen tends to be more eco-friendly - less harmful to the ocean life and coral reefs (there are some chemical sunscreen ingredients that are very harmful and others that are considered safe) and some people find their skin tolerates it better. If im wearing makeup and reapply sunscreen will be impractical, I tend to opt for a physical sunscreen. If I'll be in and out of the water all day, i usually choose a sunscreen that is easy to apply to wet/damp skin so its always quick and easy to stay on top of it.",

Super useful and really well written hehe I went through similar lasering (ablative) with other procedures on my face, so I've gone through a similar experience to the fractionated laser! I'm just putting another view point / experience out there :) The ointment I was given was [Dermeze](https://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/buy/87240/dermeze-treatment-ointment-100g?gclid=Cj0KCQiA9P__BRC0ARIsAEZ6irjUfSL4x41odiMA3-jkN_s_hV2QWF-vlWQShKELsW5Ko5Ox2gxLGeEaAvvfEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds), to be used for the first 3-4 days until it felt like my skin barrier had somewhat come back. My derm recommended dermeze and aquaphor equally. This was because my skin was so intentionally damaged that it couldn't actually handle creams yet. Once you feel like the skin is healing over / not scabbing, you can just use anything hydrating and occlusive which is benign - no actives like vitamin A, vitamin C, aha, bha etc. Vitamins B are good though! E.g., b3, b5 / niacinamide, panthenol. My derm gave me a benign one however I prefer my CeraVe stuff, which the clinic approved usage of. I made my own bit of a regime here and used a really hydrating moisturiser (CeraVe moisturising lotion - more hydrating than occlusive IMO) to get the goodness from the ceramides and hydration and then locked it in with the ointment in the AM and PM. This really sped up the healing for me IMO. When I graduated onto only using moisturizing creams without the ointment, I added in centella, niacinamide, panthenol, and marula oil. All really benign things which assist in healing. A cream with vitamin E could also be really nourishing. I've gone through this lasering 3 times and each time I've recovered almost fully within 5-6 days instead of the generic 7-14 day period. Chemical sunscreen is good and will be the easiest to apply especially over rougher skin. However, *it might make your skin a bit irritated and more pink*. I was told to use a mineral sunscreen for around a month just for irritation purposes. I didn't feel any stinging or any side effects, it's purely an aesthetics thing. It won't actually inhibit your recovery, more just an aesthetics warning and so you're not concerned re damage if you see extra redness! I used a chemical sunscreen post laser and freaked out because my face was SO RED I was actually scared I burned the shit out of my skin notwithstanding using more than the recommended amount of sunscreen for my face. I had another appointment with my derm because I thought I ruined my skin. They said it's just irritation from the chemicals, which has proven true as there's no pigmentation or tanning etc and the pinkness faded after a few days (I tan so if it was sun damage then it'd go darker) :p &#x200B; > Scabbing will increase severity of scarring If you get scabbing, under no circumstances should you rub or remove the scab etc. Only let it fall off naturally. If your skin is shedding/peeling at all, let it fall off naturally. Removing any of it while it's scabby etc will make scarring much worse than just if the scab did it's natural thing.",

That being said, you'll also have a conversation piece if it's noticeable enough.100% flawless skin is nice, but it's also boring. Scars add character. You can let it hurt your self-esteem, or you can accept it as something that distinguishes you from others (in a good way, imo). I wish you the best of luck with the healing process. Edit: ideally, you never see a single scab. Scabs are good for keeping infection out, but they're a sign that the wound is dry. You need moisture to heal properly (including reduced scarring).

Starting this before the wound stars scabbing is really important, so get into the derm ASAP! I also recently got stitches and my derm recommended Aquafor non stop on that as well. I still have a scar, but it is much less pronounced than my other surgery scar where they did not tell me of the magic of petroleum jelly.

Clean gently by rinsing with cold water (don't use your cleanser / exfoliation on that side of your face), keep from touching and put a dressing (non-adhesive 2\" by 2\" gauze pads with medical tape) on it while you shower or sleep to keep your pillowcase from pulling off the scabs and little daubs of polysporin thinly layered on it (like, pea sized amount for all of it). Moisturizing around the edges should be fine so long as your hands are clean, just don't apply any to the abrasions themselves.",

I recently had top surgery and my surgeon's method for healing nipple grafts is gently coating the surface with Aquaphor and Adaptic non-adhering dressing. Cover that with a non stick bandage (and a gentle medical tape to hold the non stick bandage on). With this method, you likely won't scab and you'll heal quite quickly, minimizing scarring. Dress the wound as long necessary, until it's completely healed. If there are signs of scarring weeks later, silicone tape or gel is generally the first line treatment. If that doesn't work out, tretinoin is also a highly effective scar treatment. While healing, make sure you're getting plenty of vitamin C and rest! You're definitely going to need to cut your routine down to a bare minimum while you're healing. Gentle cleanser + wound dressing once per day, and that's it. Preventing infection is a priority as well, so using an antibiotic ointment with your Aquaphor and dressing is a solid move. Happy healing!",

I am constantly doing things to prevent scarring. You could also get a hyaluronic acid supplement, but I do not take that one yet personally (but plan on it) *Also frankincense oil gets rid of hyperpigmentation from scars, I put it on my cystic acne spots daily (twice) along with a bit of jojoba oil as a carrier oil (like 1 drop of each oil is good) and it prevents the area from getting hyperpigmentation and I also read it helps heal scars.

        "body": "I see you already got lots of good advice, but as someone who also took a nasty fall straight to the face once and came out with zero scarring I'd like to add my input :) *The sad backstory: this happened a few years ago. I was heading home in the dark with heavy shopping bags in both arms. Tripped over the tiniest step and fell. Because my self preservation instincts are great, I held on to the bags and totally saved the eggs, instead of, you know my face...* So there I was looking like I got beat up. After cleaning up and sleeping my sorrows away, I started doing research. The most important think I learned was that scarring occurs because the wounds scab over. To prevent that you need to moisturize the hell out of them. I ordered my supplies: \u2022 Large jar of petroleum jelly (vaseline). *For the moisturizing.* \u2022 Savlon healing gel. *This little miracle creates the perfect conditions for wound healing. As a side note, you can also use it to relieve the pain of burns.* \u2022 Bandaids \u2022 Palmer's cocoa butter. *Seriously, this stuff is amazing for skin.* At least twice per day (definitely before bed though) I would use the healing gel. I liked covering it with a bandaid so that I wouldn't accidentally rub it off. As savlon dries it creates a dry skin like layer, which eventually you wash off (gently) and reapply. I used the vaseline in between, basically as often as I could. And I introduced the cocoa butter once the wounds started getting better. I don't usually use it on my face (only because I read it can make acne issues worse) but this was the exception. And one more thing I did was use compresses created by tissues or cotton pads soaked in hot(ish) tea. I think I alternated between camomile, green and black tea. As for the psychological side of things, I took a picture of my face every day so that I could see the progress. That really helped me not feel so bad about it. I followed this routine and within two weeks most of it was healed. I also had wounds on my arms and knees, but once my face healed up I got so excited I kind of stopped bothering with the routine, and now I still have scars there. Since my face came out completely clear I'm sure I could have avoided scarring there as well if I'd stuck with the routine a bit longer. I hope everything turns out well for you. You deserve all the good karma for saving that bunny! EDIT: also I used no other face products during this time, no regular moisturizer, face wash etc. *Definitely* no acids. When things began to improve I started using my moisturizer on the healthy parts of skin but only the vaseline to moisture the wounds themselves. Also I did use rubbing alcohol (the one meant for wounds that's only like 1%) to clean the wounds on that first day, but not after as I was worried it would cause scarring. But I also kept them clean with water and mostly covered by bandaids.",

Like in your comment, I used aquaphor quite often. I think I cleaned my face twice a day with super gentle soap, might've been baby soap, then reapplied aquaphor. I was told to let it breathe rather than dress it. Most importantly I stayed out of the sun entirely for the first month, and stayed inside as much as possible for the next month. This was stressed heavily to me by my doctor because any tanning that happened at this time might tan the skin underneath, leaving it permanently darker than the rest of my face. After that I could safely just put on high spf sunscreen each day, wash and moisturize each night. The whole year I religiously put on sunscreen and usually a cover up that also offered some sun protection. Now, I should probably take better care of my skin but it all acts like my regular skin again. Good luck OP. It sucks, but at least during covid, masks offer plenty of extra sun protection.",

I have to say that you will never 100% get rid of this kind of scaring but you can dramatically minimize it with proper care. Petroleum jelly on the wounds 24/7 while healing. Absolutely no sun allowed to touch face while healing. Once completely healed a good vitamin C will work wonders. I recommend skinceuticals. It's super expensive but it will last 6+ months of daily use. If you have the money, get yourself red LED to promote healing and keep the scar minimized.",

You need to let it scab over \u2013 that\u2019s the skin\u2019s way of protecting itself while new tissue regenerates underneath. Covering it with product is only going to risk infection.

It would be best if you manage to see a doctor but you can apply an appropriate dressing already. I had a pharmacist recommend thick layer of gel plus gauze and let me tell you that did not go well - most of my remaining scarring was caused by the sticking gauze :( Aquphor is good, an antibiotic ointment may be even better to make sure it doesn't get infected.

You can buy larger sheets and trim to fit with sterile scissors.

With further care and time they can probably be less noticable but my husband doesn't care that much. Just to give you perspective, he had to get 21 stitches on his face restitching his face back together above his lip and the bridge of his nose. He washed his face with a clean, non abrasive, zinc and honey soap twice daily. After, as his moisturizer and antibacterial ointment, he used Medicine Mama's product Bee Magic. The soap is also from Medicine Mamas. I can't say enough about the product. It's amazing. I gave some to my cousin for his babies burned hand and it cleared up the burn, saving them from surgery, within a couple of weeks. My husband applied Bee Magic twice a day after washing. Once his open wounds healed, he used a Vit. C serum regularly that is great for the cellular health of the collagen matrix beneath the skin. Super helpful for keeping the skin moisturized and healthy. We use Silver Botanical's Botanical-C Serum. Since the skin and its healing are connected to the gut, he cut out most sugar and gluten hoping to eliminate extra inflammation. He has since added some sugar back and limited gluten. I also asked him to take some enzymes and probiotics. He took an enzyme and anti inflammatory combination by Transformation called Protease IFC in between meals 2 - 3 times a day. Also, 2 probiotics in the evening before bed mostly because he was having to take antibiotics. In your case you might find plenty of probiotics in some foods like yogurt or kimchi. I hope this is helpful.",

With a wound this big and on your face, the best person you can take advice from is from a board certified dermatologist, even if it\u2019s through a virtual visit.

Bacitracin doesn\u2019t seem to be as reactive as Neosporin, but has also been shown to do the same thing.

I have minimal scarring despite having extremely sensitive skin. Maybe disinfect, apply aquaphor, and book a derm appointment in the meantime. when it comes to falling off your bike, if you're interested, you can try taking up another hobby like parkour, gymnastics, judo etc. Even a couple of lessons will teach you how to fall on the ground gracefully and not get hurt too badly.

So you're skin just kind of dies .......btw this is me....I should've patch tested differin somewhere else on my body before putting it on my face. I'm learning that I have over-reactive skin in general and that I might eternally just need products that are very simple. What's funny is that no derm will suggest any type of treatment plan to help calm down my skin. It over reacts to everything. My environment....food.....stress....EVERYTHING ( but only where I applied the retinoid, so that's how I know the retinoid caused this madness). So yes...everyone please patch test. My situation isn't unique or rare. I've found lots of stories on the internet including Reddit, where women and girls have really screwed up their skin and no doctor they go will even acknowledge what they're experiencing day to day with their new skin problems a.k.a SEVERE SENSITIVITY AND DISCOMFORT caused by like I said ...EVERYTHING. Since no doctor will acknowledge my extreme discomfort, they cant suggest an appropriate plan of action to help it. Pain killers dull the pain and discomfort caused by the INSANELY BAD irritation ( which btw, one derm was SO DISMISSIVE to my symptoms that I can only say she just wanted to get me out of her office because she prescribed me a very serious nerve medication to numb the pain that would've done ABSOLUTELY nothing for what was actually causing the issue--- which is the fact that my skin is so easily severely inflamed because it never healed from the reaction it had to the differin .1%) Don't find yourself in this situation, #1 with your skin ending up being so unfathomably problematic and then #2 also having doctors try to convince you to try serious medications without having a decent explanation, #3 leaving your doctor's office with absolutely no plan of treatment that makes sense. Someone suggested that it might've been an allergic reaction to the product differin .1%. I agree....but just because we have a possible explanation doesn't mean my problems just disappear. Every doctor I've gone to immediately tried to treat my existing acne, wouldn't acknowledge the current hour to hour discomfort and flat out debilitating pain I experience even while sitting in front of them, and would tell me they don't see anything wrong. It's been the most unexplainably, discouraging, humiliating experience of my life to have doctors just dismiss me the way they have. I've been dealing with this for an entire year now. I can use whatever moisturizer that claims to calm your skin and that's fine...but there is something FUNDAMENTALLY wrong and dysfunctional with my skin. I firmly believe that my skin in its resting state is just super reactive. So I never should've used such a strong retinoid....probably ever. My skin (facial skin over my nose and inner cheeks only) has frequent flare ups of some kind and acquires new damage every time a serious flare up happens that never heals. Nobody I talk to, even medical professionals, will try to help me find out what to label these flare ups or even advise me on what I can do to stop the possible permanent damage I get from them. This started happening after I used the differin. I only used it once. I could keep going on and on. Patch test ......that is my point.",

Something I wish I knew earlier because I would try to bring them to the surface and pop them and it never worked out and made things more inflamed, but yet I kept doing it. The gland overproduces oil and hormones from our foods are extreted into the pores around our jawline, neck, and chin. The wall of the pore breaks down causing some serious inflammation. I started an extra strength omega 3 fish oil along with a multi strain probiotic, multivitamin, zinc, and I am just starting magnesium back up because pretty much everyone is deficient in that mineral and it's such a vital one. Magnesium glycinate seems to be the best so far. My cystic acne has gotten better but I need to lay off dairy and processed foods. Here in the US there is so many bad things in our foods that other countries don't allow.",

        "body": "I have visible scars on my face, the most prominent being an approximately 1.5 inch scar on my lower face from a childhood accident. I went through several rounds of painful plastic surgery to minimize the scarring, but over 20 years later it's still obvious. I don't cover it, or put anything on it, or continue to treat it, and I don't wear makeup ever. And I refuse to go through anymore plastic surgery cuz fuck that shit, it sucks. When I first got my scars, I was pretty self conscious about it. Other kids stared. It made me feel uncomfortable. I don't know how, when or why, but eventually I stopped giving a shit. I came to see my scars as unique and beautiful. They aren't flaws or ugly, if anything they make me look pretty cool. So it makes me happy seeing facial scarring as treated as perfectly fine in beauty advertising. Scars should never be seen as ugly. And people shouldn't be made to feel bad for being physically scarred. Edit: I wanted to add since I've gotten so many lovely replies, that whoever you are reading this, just know that you are beautiful! Those \"flaws\" you see when you look in the mirror aren't inherently bad. They are just things that make you different and unique. Don't let anything take away your self-love and or diminish your beauty \ud83d\udc9c",

Estheticians will tell you your skin is too bumpy, or point out that your sideburns are just a touch too long to get you to use hair removal and facial peel treatments. Plastic surgeons will tell you you definitely could use a nose tweak. Dentists will casually tell you that they'd \"like to do front teeth caps\" in the future -- a common treatment for high-profile actors to have perfect pearly whites -- when your teeth are totally fine. That's not to say that ALL estheticians, dentists, and surgeons will do this to you to make a quick buck off your insecurities. In fact, the vast majority of them don't. But some of them do, and they're bad people.",

I also tend to add an extra teaspoon (or half) of table salt to the average 28 oz bottle it comes packaged in If you're still \"thirsty\" I would say get some blood work done just in case you're concerned. There's a new sort of blood sugar test where they measure coating on mature red blood cells that doesn't require fasting. It's not as \"precise\" but it can give you peace of mind (as I had a pre-diabetes scare of my own a while back. Long story, but I gained a lot of weight due to an injury and didn't slow down my eating habits.)",

Pre-diabetes/diabetes is much more complex than that and related to your pancreas struggling with longer term lifestyle habits.

I have heard that licking lips is actually really bad, especially for people that already have issues with dry lips. I don't remember exactly but here's the info straight from Wikipedia: [\"Lip licking, biting, or rubbing habits are frequently involved.[6] Paradoxically, constant licking of the lips causes drying and irritation, and eventually the mucosa splits or cracks.[3] The lips have a greater tendency to dry out in cold, dry weather.[citation needed] Digestive enzymes present in saliva may also irritate the lips, and the evaporation of the water in saliva saps moisture from them.[9]\"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheilitis)",

Then, a few years ago, I discovered Nuxe Reve de Miel lip balm. GAME CHANGER. The price was offputting, but a jar lasts me 6 months, minium. The ooooold formula used to be far superior (and more expensive. It was worth it, though), but the newer formula (it was reformulated maybe 3 or 4 years ago) is still wonderful. If you're in the US, it's no longer sold through US retailers, but Feel Unique sells it and does worldwide affordable (sometimes free) shipping. https://us.feelunique.com/p/NUXE-Reve-de-Miel-Baume-Levres-Ultra-Nourrissant-Ultra-Nourishing-Lip-Balm-15g What I do is in the morning, I apply a thin layer before I do anything else. Before I shower, eat, or brush my teeth. By the time I've showered and brushed my teeth, most of the balm has rubbed off. Before applying a lip color, if there is a lot left, pat my lips lightly with a tissue, not rubbing. At night, once I'm done with my skincare, I apply a nice layer. RIGHT before turning in for the night, I apply a thin layer of Vaseline or Aquaphor on top, to seal in the wonderful moisture from the Nuxe balm. To be honest, in the summer the night application is more than enough, but I currently have the heat running 24/7 and even with a humidifier, it's wrecking me. But that's it! No more needing to apply lip balm through the day.",

My other favorite is the Palmer's cocoa butter stick, it looks like a glue stick. That is amazing and very moisturizing. I've tried a lot of stuff but these two are my favorites. Palmer's sells a smaller version of the cocoa butter stick but the normal glue stick looking version is a better bang for your buck. I know, nobody asked but I'm really passionate about this lol ...

The CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion in the pump bottle is my all time favorite. Apply this after Step 3. The thing is that the ingredients can really dry out and irritate your skin if you\u2019re not careful. If it\u2019s working for you though, I would stick with it! If you notice your skin is red and flaky, I\u2019d cut down to only using it at night. Also, make sure you use a moisturizer with SPF in the morning as benzoyl peroxide can make your skin more prone to sun damage :) Oh and if you want a cheaper alternative to the Proactiv system, a gentle cleanser (CeraVe or Cetaphil), alcohol free toner (optional), 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide Gel (you can find online or at the drugstore) and a nice moisturizer (once again CeraVe or Cetaphil) will do the same thing for you. It\u2019d probably be much less drying and irritating as well. :)",

My Mum couldn't afford my full course of treatment so I stopped taking the Accutane and I've had on and off breakouts since then. Only recently I think I found the most effective skincare routine for me, every product I use is so gentle and hydrating and my skin loves it so much more, and **definitely** more affordable than some popular brands. Skincare is such a trial and error sort of deal, Its so important and it's something that so many people (especially a lot of guys) have never really had explained to them.

I feel like she's always trying to play innocent in the media, even after her whole Pepsi debacle, and she just literally never grows from it. Any sort of 'stance' she's made has gone like a trend and a lot of other models have come out against her because despite being a huge anomaly in their industry she apparently doesn't talk to any of them or even immerse herself in what their actual lives are like. Idk, maybe I'm just reaching or something but she irks me more than the rest of them, then again they've all done morally questionable things (including their weird laxative tea sponsorships) so maybe I'm just giving the others a pass.",

Don\u2019t use too many products at the same time and give your skin time to adjust. The only routine that truly worked for me was Cerave hydrating facial cleanser, Andalou Naturals Fruit Stem Cell Science toning refresher, and Aloe BHA skin toner. The ingredients I think that really worked were ceramides, aloe Vera, snail gel, betaglucan, sodium hyaluronate. Also BTW the last toner I recommended has too high of a Ph for the salicylic acid to work effectively so I just use it more as a moisturiser rather than like an acid treatment lol",

Both of the toners I recommended are moisturising though and naturally have a pretty smooth/light application. However, Argan oil is pretty much the heaviest thing I used on my skin while I was repairing it and it\u2019s extremely good at moisturising + I think you can use it as a serum.

The first few days were fine, I was over the moon thinking it would clear my skin. This is the point I realised I have really sensitive skin and shouldn't be doing this twice a day! By day three I had some pretty serious chemical burns that I figured were just a sign of the products working. I came down stairs one morning and my mother let out a scream as she saw how my skin looked... She took me to the doctors that morning, who then referred me to a skin specialist at the hospital via A&E. It took almost 2 months for my skin to recover and it's taken about 10 years for me to start becoming interested in skincare again! I've built a little routine almost exclusively of products from The Ordinary (they are cheap, effective and haven't disagreed with my skin!) and finally I have clear, healthy skin! I've warned everyone I know about this stuff and wouldn't dream of allowing my children should I choose to have them to use it!",

        "body": "I had no idea they produced ads like this \ud83e\udd22 I had horrible hormonal(now I know) acne as a child until my early 20's when I went on spironolactone and birth control. I've since gone off BC for health related issues, but I'm still on spiro and found a good skincare routine that works for me, and my facial skin has been amazing. &nbsp; I started getting acne around just 8 years old and my dad pushed this stuff on me like crazy. A few times he took me into the bathroom and literally showed me how to wash my face because he insisted that I either wasn't washing or didn't know how to wash my face properly or use the products because all the famous people on TV said it works. &nbsp; When my mom divorced him and we moved out, I even asked my grandparents for it and they would buy the kits for me whenever they could. My GP was totally against me using Accutane, so I continued using this crap and scrubbing it into my skin super hard. I used the night mask for spot treatment every night. There wasn't much I could do for my back and chest since they were such large surfaces and would use up the products too quickly, so I just assumed I was destined to be \"ugly\" and never have a boyfriend(I made up my mind that if a boy asked me out, I would just say no), be able to wear a bathing suit, or even wear short sleeves or a tank top. I'd wear sweaters in the summer, I'd get laughed at and \"grossss\" in locker rooms. To top it off, my back was also hairy. I definitely had a hormonal issue. &nbsp; I even remember using toothpaste masks because my grandma and I read in a magazine that it'd help. None of it helped, ever, obviously. It made my skin super greasy from stripping it, I always felt embarrassed because I thought I looked \"sweaty\". &nbsp; In my late teens I got on Accutane, but my dermatologist didn't give me the full treatment when he saw it was working for some reason, so I went on it again about a year later. That seems to have made a big difference, and by that time I had realized Proativ was shite, but I was still using some pretty harsh things on my face and would get breakouts on my lower face and upper back a lot. After I went on birth control, they mostly cleared up, but then my new derm recommended spironolactone because he said it looked like I had hormonal acne. &nbsp; Now I use a lot gentler products and make moisturizing my priority. My skin was left horribly scarred by Proativ and years of acne though. It really messed up my self esteem. I still feel weird wearing short sleeves,bathing suits,and tanks, or even letting my bf see my back. Weirdly, he likes my back, but that means he pays attention and I feel uncomfortable that it's so badly scarred. I'm light/medium skinned and I just have tons of pale spots everywhere from scarring. &nbsp; Really angry to see that they'd release an ad like this, after their products made a lot of our skin worse. I would never ever recommend their products to anyone. I was weirded out to see their products at Ulta, and now I think even Sephora carries them? Also, the Kardashians are so wealthy I don't think any of them are using Proactiv if they get a pimple lol. Js. They're so influential that it seems irresponsible to recommend this.",

I\u2019ve been using L\u2019Or\u00e9al triple lift moisturizer and I love it. It Has salycic acid and hylauranic acid. I stoped using any type of exfoliate because it dries my skin out profusely and causes it to flake. That\u2019s actually what is making me break out. I started using Cetaphil face wash but it\u2019s really drying out my skin too. My eyes were so bad I had to use Vaseline on them but now they\u2019re getting better. Mind you, I just turned 37 and it\u2019s like BOOM, F u, kiss your skin goodbye lol. Like I said the L\u2019Or\u00e9al cream does wonders but what\u2019s a good alternative to the other products I\u2019ve been using?

Do you due diligence on the ingredients as you would any other product and you\u2019ll be fine. If they were selling fake products, they\u2019d be in trouble and this wouldn\u2019t stay a secret. It\u2019s usually over stock, last season items from stores that needed space. Most skincare products are good for 3 years. Once you open them, look on the package or product itself and there is a little container looking thing that as a number in it. That\u2019s how long it\u2019s good once it\u2019s opened. I use an app (beauty keeper) and enter in new products whenever I get them, and then use the \u201cdate opened on\u201d area obviously when I open it.

The TJ Maxx marketing team has the employees group things by label color and randomly being unloaded into a rainbow by use (skin, hair, makeup, etc). You see the rainbow but don't consider it though you are going to look heavily at each thing. Hoping you find a want or good enough to switch you. You find more extras and even if you find the NEED later, you justify them as :treats\"",

Idk if the masks you mention are as effective but I'm guessing no since they do it with a machine in the clinic and they also put like a gel in your skin before for protection, kinda like the ones that are used in ultrasounds. It's also important to keep in mind that hydrating and moisturizing are not the same thing. If you have oily skin, it means your skin lacks hydration actually so it's creating more oils. Using a water base hydration product that will recover your skin at a cellular level is most appropriate in this case (I use the Hydro boost water gel by Neutrogena) . If your skin is dry or normal, using a moisturizer that will keep the moisture in your skin is best, products with Shea Butter are great.",

I\u2019ve definitely seen the skin brightening effects from that. I\u2019ve used the neutrogena hydro boost as well and idk if it made all that much of a difference. Like I felt like I had to use a lot per application to make my skin feel adequately moisturized (like for night time), and it\u2019s kinda expensive for drugstore skin that would make the product go by faster. Like it felt cooling and nice and all, but the gel not itself not very rich for night time use? It\u2019s fine for day time use under makeup though, especially for people with oily/oily combo skin.",

In college a friend told me that I was too old for clean and clear lol and that just totally shifted my perspective on how I approached my skin. I started to learn abt PH balance and how diff ingredients work. I started to play around with serums and limited ingredient stuff. Was a really effective change - largely because my skin was actually much drier than I realized - it was red and irritated most of the time from the random shit I would use, but I perceived that as breaking out and having clogged pores which made me add more harsh products. The Ordinary is such a good starting ground because it actually works well, and its so cheap (5-10 dol per product usually) you can experiment with different products until you find your routine. They also give you the option to send in pics of your skin (or just write a description) and they\u2019ll send you a personalized lineup guide. I\u2019ve started using them within the last few months and I\u2019m having some of my best skin days.",

My mom even sleeps in makeup sometimes (or she'll just use makeup wipes to take off makeup, but it's never 100% clean) and she still doesn't have to worry about any pimples or anything! All my brothers also have amazing skin and some of them rinse their face with water while others just use whatever random cleanser/moisturizer their girlfriend buys and they have perfect, dewy skin. Meanwhile I'm here with a huge routine and if I'm feeling lazy and decide not to put on *one* of the many products in my routine, or if I skip a mask day, I break out like crazy and then have to deal with hyperpigmentation :/",

As I got older I did more research, and learned the different causes of eczema. For me, a combination of things has kept my eczema in check: drying properly after showering by patting lightly; immediately applying a fragrance free lotion to my entire body (use to be Burts Bees, currently Cerave \u201cin the tub\u201d); being aware of allergies! (This is a big one \u261d\ufe0fI get allergic eczema from things like clothing with too much polyester, gloves with powder, fragrance in lotions/beauty products). To combat allergies I simply take a standard daily antihistamine. I\u2019ve also noticed my eczema flares up in humid climates (I live in a dry climate). I\u2019ve not learned how to combat this yet, and I\u2019m not sure why it happens as it seems counter intuitive to what I know about eczema and moisture retention.",

Zinc absolutely blasts away pimples. I\u2019ve struggled with bad acne my whole life (I\u2019m 36) and I picked up that tip several years ago on an acne.org forum. I was desperate! I buy a small travel-sized bottle every now and then in the travel products section at Walmart or Target for .97. As you said, it IS very drying, but you can wash your face with it once or twice a week (better for serious acne only IMHO) or you can use it as a spot treatment by dabbing it on the affected areas. This spot treatment approach is incredibly effective at reducing pimples FAST, and I\u2019ve tried everything in the drugstore. Again, very FAST. For only .97, I always recommend other sufferers consider giving this method a try. It\u2019s also great for treating body acne, I\u2019ve been told.",

Also if other products aren't making your skin red, then I'd probably just stick to those. I know how annoying the flaky skin can be though so it might not hurt to try it again or even just use it lightly when you need to, because it does work great for that. E: Just realized you might have took my reply the wrong way, when I was saying how long have you been on it/it'll adjust over time, I was talking about being on tret and how your skin will become less sensitive over time leading to less redness.",

You can end up with broken capillaries, which don't go away unless you undergo laser treatment for them. Depending upon your skin, it may also give you trouble with scars. I'm very prone to scarring and redness, so if I pick, I usually end up with nasty red splotches where I've been picking (but I have seen people on here say they don't get scars if they pop a zit as opposed to waiting it out so YMMV).

Today my cheeks are super flushed, tingly/burning, and covered in pustules. \n\nI may have overdone it with cicaplast and it trapped heat and caused this? I had been using it at night only but yesterday I used it during the day too. I had been trying to use spf on my cheeks but chemical ones burn and mineral ones are too heavy. Both end up causing flares due to irritation (filters in chemical ones, occlusion from mineral ones trap heat). \n\n**My routine** that I do during and after flareups is just a water rinse in the am + vanicream (tub version). Then at night I use vanicream cleanser and the same moisturizer. \n\nHowever during some flareups I\u2019ve had success with just using cicaplast. Other times it seems to make it worse\u2026so I really am at a loss. ",
