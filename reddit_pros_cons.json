I never pay full price for facials, products, ect\u2026 so the deal was get 1 RF treatment for $199.00 & get it anywhere else on your body for free so I chose my face & abdomen. So now I officially have a membership because I seen such a huge difference on my stomach!!!! My face not as much but I think it\u2019s because I really didn\u2019t need it on my face but it did bring out my jawline a lot!!! They take before & after pics because they show you the difference that day\u2026 so I\u2019m actually going Sat & doing my stomach again & with the membership I can go once every mnth so I\u2019m going to alternate back & forth & do my abdomen then do what they call a butt lift. During my yr membership I might get my face done again but idk. But it must have done a whole lot of something for me to get a membership!! I\u2019m not even a member @ my spa\u2026 so I would highly recommend looking into a RF skin tightening facial. It\u2019s non surgical & it\u2019s completely painless.

      "Hi, I've recently started using the aeropress I bought 5+ years ago. I've mostly drank keurig and nespressos since I stopped drinking tims and drip coffee. Basics of what I have going hardware wise is a sboly conical 19 grind setting grinder, a crappy kettle that I've recently cleaned with vinegar and rinsed very thoroughly at the start of this journey. The first bag of beans I decided to buy was a washed Ethiopian with tasting note of rose, peach lemonade, and apricot jam. From what I gather, this would be higher in acidity, less bitter, lighter flavor than almost anything, or the lightest I've ever had before. Am I correct in saying that acidity can come off as sour to underdeveloped pallets? This brings me to the grinder. The grinder was given to me with some beans still in the hopper. I tried a cup of that from the areopress and it was extreamly sour. I'm guessing this is due to the old age of the beans and being out in the open in the hopper for likely months. I cleaned out the grinder what I knew I could at the time, I didn't want to break it. I started using the bad of beans I bought and it was coming out very sour still. I this reduced over the next few cups as the old stuff came out more. Then I got more brave and discovered how to open it up and remove the top burr and was able to clean it out a lot better using a air can to use on computers to blow stuff out even better. I've ended up reducing the grind setting to 4 from the finest. For my brew method with the aeropress, as you may have guessed, im using the James Hoffmann method. I'm doing 12g coffee 200g ish usually a bit more because I'm bad at pouring but never less. 2min wait, swirl to break the crust, 30s wait, press gently and slowly aim for 30s press time. The water I've been using has been boiling on the bottom of the kettle as I pour, as I think you want as hot as you can for light roast? I'm using carbon filtered water from an aqua gear filter. Now with the grinder as clean as I think I can get it with what I think is a good grind setting and I think a good technique, its still a bit sour. This sour is far far more enjoyable than that of the old leftover bean. I've run around 200g of this new bean thru the grinder so far. My question is, might the sourness I'm tasting be from the bean selection and the roast? Or might I need to do an even deeper clean of the grinder? Maybe I'm messing up a step somewhere else? Maybe I'm doing everything right and it's all hunky dory? Thanks! Edit: I should add that before I received this grinder that I got a bag from a local roaster and had them grind it for me fresh. It was a medium roast with surprisingly no mention of anything on the bag other than their name. It was fairly coarsely ground like coarser than folders I'd say. I did tell them I'd be using an areopress and they said their grinder had a button for that so I dunno. Anyway the point of this is that there was no sourness coming from that bag at all and it was definitely more of the traditional dark earthy coffee kind of flavor.",
      "I want to make better coffee, but I don't truly know where to begin, because I think I treat it differently to most coffee drinkers. I currently have been using ground coffee in a moka pot that I got as a gift from work for my five-year anniversary. [This guy.](https://www.amazon.com/London-Sip-Stainless-Stove-Top-Percolator/dp/B09X1ZJKMP) As a way to occasionally make one single cup of coffee, it works for me. I don't drink coffee regularly and only brew for one of three reasons: I decide to make one because I decide I would like the caffeine or I just feel like having a coffee; I am making mixed drinks (like espresso martinis or carajillos) and need it; or I have a guest who asks for some. However, relying on pre-ground coffee hasn't been ideal. I brew it so irregularly (maybe once or twice a month) that the grounds just sit around in an airtight bag for a long time. I also have some nice beans I've picked up on travel that I want to make the most of, so I bought [the hand grinder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXZACFB) recommended in the wiki here that's under $50. Which circles back to the moka pot. I like how it works, and its ease--I fill the reusable filter with grounds, and the bottom cavity with water. And then I just leave it on a burner until the coffee is finished brewing. But I also find a lot of the time it's burned my coffee despite me following the directions directly, and the build quality, while fine, feels cheap and unlikely to last. Should I replace the moka pot? What should I do about the coffee getting burned?",

Everybody on Reddit is praising the SM-S mugs, but I've not heard anything about the SV thermoses. Does anybody have experience with the SV-G or SM-Z lines and could share their thoughts? Are they as good at keeping temperature as the more popular mugs? Would it be comfortable to drink straight out of an SV-GR (for example, in a car, where pouring into the cup is not ideal)?",

There are many different potential mechanisms, including: * Poor gut health just leading people to feel bad due to unpleasant symptoms, which is an additional stressor that can worsen mental health * Poor gut health blocking absorption of nutrients, leading to deficiencies that can worsen mental health * Poor gut health resulting in the creation and/or absorption of toxins and/or other harmful compounds which can negatively effect mental health * Good gut health facilitating absorption of nutrients, and even synthesis of those nutrients in the gut * Good gut health (esp. through high fiber intake) resulting in more stable blood sugar which stabilizes mood swings * Gut health modulating the immune system, and infections elsewhere in the body then influencing mental health There may be some more mechanisms I forgot, and there are also likely many mechanisms that haven't even been discovered yet. Also, anecdotally, in my own life, how I eat seems to play a big role in my mental health. Also, the relationship between gut health and mental health is likely bidirectional. Gut health influences mental health, but mental health also influences gut health. Again, there are multiple mechanisms through which this can happen: * Poor mental health elevating stress level which reduces the \"rest and digest\" nervous system, thus harming gut health. * Poor mental health increasing cravings for unhealthy foods, disrupting gut health. * Poor mental health leading to more disordered eating habits, similarly disrupting gut health. * Poor mental health suppressing or weakening the immune system, thus increasing the risk and/or severity of infections in the gut. * Good mental health making people think more rationally about diet and eating, thus improving gut health. * Good mental health making people be more on top of their life so that they have more resources with which to eat healthier. So basically both the gut and the brain are parts of systems that are interconnected in multiple ways, and a healthy state in one helps keep the other in a healthy state too.",
      "#### About participation in the comments of /r/nutrition Discussion in this subreddit should be rooted in science rather than \"cuz I sed\" or entertainment pieces. Always be wary of unsupported and poorly supported claims and especially those which are wrapped in any manner of hostility. You should provide peer reviewed sources to support your claims when debating and confine that debate to the science, not opinions of other people. **Good** - it is grounded in science and includes citation of peer reviewed sources. Debate is a civil and respectful exchange focusing on actual science and avoids commentary about others **Bad** - it utilizes generalizations, assumptions, infotainment sources, no sources, or complaints without specifics about agenda, bias, or funding. At best, these rise to an extremely weak basis for science based discussion. Also, off topic discussion **Ugly** - (removal or ban territory) it involves attacks / antagonism / hostility towards individuals or groups, downvote complaining, trolling, crusading, shaming, refutation of all science, or claims that all research / science is a conspiracy *Please vote accordingly and report any uglies* --- *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

      "I\u2019ve been using Chat GPT to help with my meal planning the past month or so. I put in what style of cuisine I want to eat for the next two weeks, i.e.; Asian, Comfort Food, Mexican, etc., what type of proteins to use, and have it generate not only a list of recipes, but also put those recipes into a rotation where I never eat the same thing twice in a row. I meal prep for both lunch and dinner, so this is definitely a bonus. I also have it adapt the recipes to my instant pot and slow cooker, which makes clean up a breeze. Here is a sample of what I\u2019ve input and received for the next two weeks, and the recipe rotation. My input: Make a rotating recipe list for lunch and dinner the next two weeks using these ingredients: Boneless chicken breasts Smoked beef sausage Cream cheese Shredded Colby Jack Frozen mixed vegetables Pinto beans Canned whole kernel corn Green beans Diced tomatoes with green chilis Hummus Low carb tortillas Fresh diced tomatoes Bell pepper strips Celery sticks Fresh jalape\u00f1o\u2019s Enchilada sauce Jasmine rice ChatGPT results: Here\u2019s a 2-week rotating recipe plan for lunch and dinner using the ingredients you listed. Each meal is diabetic-friendly, balanced, and makes the most of your pantry and freezer without needing extra shopping. \u2e3b WEEK 1 Monday \u2022 Lunch: Chicken Veggie Wraps \u2013 Saut\u00e9 diced chicken, frozen mixed vegetables, and bell pepper strips. Season lightly. Add shredded Colby Jack and wrap in low-carb tortillas. \u2022 Dinner: Sausage & Pinto Bean Skillet \u2013 Slice smoked sausage and pan-fry with pinto beans, green beans, and a spoonful of diced tomatoes with green chilis. \u2e3b Tuesday \u2022 Lunch: Celery & Hummus Snack Plate \u2013 Pair celery sticks, bell pepper strips, and jalape\u00f1o slices (optional heat) with a generous serving of hummus. \u2022 Dinner: Enchilada Chicken Bake \u2013 Layer cooked chicken, enchilada sauce, cream cheese, shredded cheese, and diced tomatoes with green chilis in a baking dish. Bake until bubbly. \u2e3b Wednesday \u2022 Lunch: Pinto Bean & Corn Salad Wraps \u2013 Mix canned corn, pinto beans, fresh tomatoes, and bell peppers with light seasoning. Wrap in tortillas. \u2022 Dinner: Smoked Sausage Stir-Fry \u2013 Saut\u00e9 sausage with mixed vegetables and jalape\u00f1os. Serve over jasmine rice. \u2e3b Thursday \u2022 Lunch: Chicken Jalape\u00f1o Roll-Ups \u2013 Mix shredded chicken, cream cheese, jalape\u00f1os, and Colby Jack. Spread on tortillas and roll up. Chill and slice. \u2022 Dinner: Tomato & Bean Rice Bowl \u2013 Cook jasmine rice. Top with pinto beans, diced tomatoes with green chilis, saut\u00e9ed green beans, and sprinkle with cheese. \u2e3b Friday \u2022 Lunch: Low-Carb Sausage Lettuce Tacos (if you have lettuce) \u2013 Or use tortillas. Fill with sausage, corn, and veggies. Top with fresh tomatoes and jalape\u00f1os. \u2022 Dinner: Creamy Chicken Veggie Skillet \u2013 Cook chicken, stir in cream cheese and frozen vegetables. Add Colby Jack for a creamy finish. YMMV and good luck.",
      "I like to pick 1 soup, 1 casserole/rice dish, 2 proteins (that I either make a salad of heat up canned veggies with), and a pasta sauce of some kind. What recipe of each varies week to week depending on sales and ingredients I have but I make sure to check off each of those boxes. (Note: I'm ADHD so my method of \"loosely planned/organized\" may not work for you. I just work better with broad categories to check off and lots of creative wiggle room to work with. Lol)",
      "I save recipes I like or am interested in (I use Paprika). I'm in some different cooking subs and I browse food blogs, cookbooks etc to find stuff that sounds good and download the recipe. When it's time to go shopping I check what's on sale and try to plan around that as well as what produce is in season, what my husband and I want to eat, what we already have in the freezer/pantry, etc.",
      "I keep a list of things I've made in the past that I enjoyed eating and would eat again. But that list has some organization to it. Categories like: Meatless, High Protein, Low Calorie, Low Time Commitment, Salad, Soup, Pasta, Lasts Long Time in Fridge, Assembly Required etc. This is normally the type of stuff I consider when I think about what I want to prepare for the week. It also gives me a good idea if my recipe count is lagging in any area. In addition to categories, I also have ingredients per recipe recorded along with reasonable substitutions. There are times when I have an excess of some kitchen staple or something is expiring and I need to use it soon. So I'll search for that ingredient to quickly figure out what I've used it for in the past. This is also helpful for weeks when you might need to budget a bit more tightly and pull from your staples as much as possible. The hard part of course is building that list. It just takes time. I've used Hellofresh as a way to try new things with little hassle. And sometimes I just find a meal prep series on YouTube and pick one that doesn't seem too hard. Just be sure to carve out time somehow to add to your list.",
      "We have a rotation of recipes. I have a coworker who loves to experiment with cooking and she tells me when she finds a good one and shares. We are an ingredient household so sometimes it\u2019s just experimenting with what we have on hand. I\u2019ve also used AI and said I have x, y, z for ingredients what can I make for however many people. Almost all of my lunches are experiments."

    "title": "My testosterone has gone from 700 in 2018 to now 297 in 2025. More than 50% reduction. My vitamin D is 28 - 32M. Suffering chronic fatigue and trauma symptoms.",
    "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1lf3rr0/my_testosterone_has_gone_from_700_in_2018_to_now/",
    "pros": [
      "Do not go on TRT immedietly. That should be a last resort because once you go on it there is no going back, as your body will shut down its natural testosterone production. You should try Tongkat Ali and Cistanche first. Both boost testosterone, and both have adaptogenic properties; meaning they can help with stress and typically anxiety as well. Try them one at a time, and you should add in 5mg of Pregnenolone as well. You could also try Shilajit (be careful a lot are fake), Ashwagandha (cycle it), DHEA, Zinc, and/or Boron. Tonkgat+Cistanche+Shilajit+DHEA+Pregnenolone is a very potent stack that all pair very well with eachother. Furthermore, if you do take Vitamin D3, it's best to take it with K2 and for most with Magnesium as well. You shouldn't just take D3 on its own. Make sure you're also eating healthy and getting enough vitamins and minerals. Taking a B-Complex could be beneficial. Additionally, for trauma Polygala is typically a game changer for most. It's best taken at 100mg dosed 3 times throughout the day, for a total of 300mg, but you can just do 50-300mg dosed once in the day if you wanted to. You could also try Gotu Kola, an incredibly potent anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) herb; Holy Basil, a very calming herb that can help with anxiety, plus it is an \"adaptogen\", so it can help with stress; Sarcosine, a chemical already found in the body with natural antidepressant effects; or Saffron, a very potent mood booster with antidepression and anti-anxiety properties. If budget isn't as much of an issue, or you're just going to take 1-3 things or so, SAM-e could potentially be of great use too, which like Sarcosine is already found in the body. If your SAM-e levels are low, you're not going to be able to cope with stress very well at all. It is also a mood booster, can improve cognition, anti-anxiety, may boost energy, and can do other various things potentially as well. I'm currently taking it and it helps, but it's like ~50/50 whether it works for someone or not.",
      "Hey man, really sorry to hear what you're going through \u2014 that's a massive drop in testosterone and the symptoms you're describing definitely line up with what a lot of people report when their T levels tank. Chronic fatigue, depersonalization, looping thoughts \u2014 it's brutal, and low vitamin D doesn\u2019t help either since it's tied to hormone function and mental clarity. You might want to look into natural support while you wait for further testing. I was in a similar place (low energy, brain fog, poor recovery from stress), and what helped me was focusing on **natural testosterone support** \u2014 not just physically, but for mental balance too. Two supplements that stood out for me were **Tongkat Ali** and **Turkesterone**. There\u2019s a UK-based brand I found called [**Vegishake.co.uk**](https://www.vegishake.co.uk/shop/) \u2014 they do clean, no-filler **organic supplements** and their [**Tongkat Ali capsules**](https://www.vegishake.co.uk/shop/) are specifically aimed at supporting **testosterone levels**, energy, and recovery. They also stock **Turkesterone**, which a lot of guys in fitness and mental wellness communities are turning to as a natural anabolic and adaptogen for **hormonal balance** and **performance** without synthetic hormones. Might be worth looking into while you wait on your cortisol and thyroid tests \u2014 supporting your body naturally while you figure things out medically can sometimes give that extra edge. Sending strength, hope you find answers and start feeling like yourself again soon.",
      "Also just to add \u2014 your **vitamin D levels at 28** are really low and could absolutely be playing a role in how you\u2019re feeling, especially when it comes to **fatigue, mood, immune function**, and even **hormonal balance** like testosterone. I\u2019d recommend checking out [**Vegishake\u2019s high-strength Vitamin D3 supplement**](https://www.vegishake.co.uk/product/vitamin-d3-51000-iu-capsule/) \u2014 it\u2019s a **massive 51,000 IU per capsule**, so you only need to take **one capsule per week**, which is way easier to manage than daily dosing. A lot of people don\u2019t realise how important proper dosing is when recovering from deficiency. But \u2014 and this is important \u2014 it\u2019s best to **take Vitamin D3 with Vitamin K2** to help direct calcium properly into the bones and prevent build-up in the arteries. You can either pair the D3 with Vegishake\u2019s [**Vitamin K2 MK-7**](https://www.vegishake.co.uk/product/vitamin-k2-mk7/), or just go for their [**combined D3 + K2 formula**](https://www.vegishake.co.uk/product/vitamin-d3-and-k2-mk7-capsules/), which makes things easier if you want an all-in-one option. I found it helpful not just for physical health, but also to support **mental clarity and stress resilience**, especially while addressing trauma and low T. Hope this helps in some way.",
      "Very sorry about your trauma Hopefully you are also seeing a professional to talk through the trauma and heal. You did not say how old you are but 297 is extremely low Testosterone levels even for someone my age at 68 I am on testosterone therapy with a Dr and my levels are in the 900 range. A good vitamin D supplement should help with your vitamin D levels. Diet and excercise are also beneficial Best of luck to you.",
      "Looping thoughts sounds like pure OCD to me. I believe OCD is part of the reason I had low T, because I couldn't sleep anymore with all the anxiety it was causing me. I tried everything naturally to fix my sleep and raise my T, but nothing worked. It even got worse because I was overtraining on basically no sleep. I was taking sleeping pills every night, and feeling like a damn zombie. Finally convinced my doc to put me on TRT. It fixed almost everything, my sleep is very good now, good energy. I still have OCD and looping thoughts, but now I have energy and motivation to deal with it and to learn to live with it. TRT could be a solution for you, ask your doc. Good luck and don't give up, being low T with no sleep was the worst part of my life, but it does get better."

      "Not a doctor, but\u2026 Panic attacks can be a sign of high cortisol, and you might be dealing with chronically elevated levels. High cortisol is often linked to low testosterone. Low vitamin D could also be part of the picture, not getting enough sun (which is common for people with anxiety) and not eating enough vitamin D-rich foods can both contribute. I\u2019d suggest getting some bloodwork done, including cortisol levels. TRT might be an option if your doctor thinks it\u2019s appropriate.

I got a fb msg from who I thought was hubby's aunt, so I foolishly sent money (turned out her account had been hacked). I should have called her and been suspicious of the email for etransfer, I kept asking what it was for , they said kitchen stuff and Thanksgiving stuff. Canadian Thanksgiving is in October and it didn't click we already had it. Everyone on her fb was sent a msg and obviously angry. My bank did not reverse it and it made the budget tighter. I felt so stupid and cried for days, especially when the bank refused to reverse it.",

A quick google search says you can clean the area thoroughly with hot soapy water, or use hot water and bleach, or a last resort a pesticide. Let the area dry fully before you put anything back.

I also have a menstrual cup but I have gained weight and have a hard time getting it in and out than I did before I loved it but don\u2019t use it much at all anymore. The reusable pads are amazing and I love them- the period underwear doesn\u2019t work for my very heavy days but I can double up on pad and underwear too and it\u2019s nice. For swimming on a period I do use a one time use tampon but only rarely as I\u2019m not a swimmer on my period often personally. I\u2019ve used cloth pads for eight years and they have paid for themselves many times at this point. They feel less plasticy and sweaty than one use pads- I didn\u2019t realize how plastic the one use pads felt until I had to buy some one a trip for an unexpected period (I now pack a few cloth pads for trips no matter what now) and the one use plastic was awful when I tried them again for that trip. It felt suffocating down there. When/ if you get cloth pads make sure to get different sizes they make a panty liner size and it is lovely for spotting. I have periods from hell with how heavy they are and the mega pads are great and unless I\u2019m wearing tight thin clothes they don\u2019t show through ever- even in my daily wear of all colors of yoga pants. They don\u2019t ride up your backside like plastic pads do- they don\u2019t even go up as far at all- and I\u2019ve never had leaking issues. Start trying some panty liner size ones- like 2-3 and use them for end of period or beginning of period spotting to try them out. They\u2019re also great for reducing the possibility of yeast infections from working out because they are easy to use while working out then you can just take them off and you have no sweat on your underwear.",

I absolutely love the fit, I've never had a leak even on my heaviest days and I've been using them for over 2 years, my oldest pairs are still going strong and just as absorbent as they were when I bought them. You don't get that wet feeling when you wear them. The don't feel bulky or like they stick out the same as when you wear a pad. They have plenty of different styles for women, including thongs and boxer briefs. They even have specific ones meant for wearing overnight on your heaviest flow days. I really cannot say more good things about this brand and its products because I find them to be incredibly good quality. The best part is they aren't even that much money and pay for themselves within a couple months of use. They also often have sales. They're super easy to wash, straight in the washing machine and dryer. 100% I recommend them to every person who bleeds down there because they are the best as far as I'm concerned. Also now Walmart sells them which is amazing because their online store is always sold out lol.",
      "I get mine from tree hugger cloth pads and have had them for about 5 years. When I first got them I\u2019d prewash them when taking them off to avoid staining, but the past few years I don\u2019t care and just throw them in my laundry and wash them with everything else. They\u2019re stained but don\u2019t smell or anything. Honestly the best decision I\u2019ve made, getting cloth pads instead of literally anything else. They\u2019re sooo comfy and they\u2019re super easy to clean",
      "I use Lil Helper reusable pads. I quite like that you can get many different lengths, with or without wings, and they will hold a lot of liquid. They are also machine washable, but I hand wash them, it's easy to do it. They are hard to stain & even if you do, it barely shows. They offer discounts to try them & if you can't really afford them, they will sell at a discount without proof required. They also have awesome mats called lifesaver mats that will save your mattress if you are someone like me who will leak past the back of a pad every time because it just wicks up the butt crack The mat doesn't move, is comfy & machine washable too! https://lilhelper.ca/",
      "I've had my period undies for almost 10 years. They're a little bleached atp, but hey, they're period underwear, right? The label says not to put them in the dryer, but I'm ungovernable, so I do anyway and they're fine. They're Thinx, I think. I also have a June menstrual cup that works really well and was very cheap when I bought it ($6.99 \"going out of business\" sale). I used to get super heavy periods (before my current BC and hormone regimen), so I used both out of necessity. Now I use both just out of habit, plus they're both very comfortable and make me feel completely secure. I've tried both disposable and reusable disks, but they've never worked for me. Way too leaky, slipping out of place, and super messy. I like the June cup because it has a little knob at the end that you can pull on without having to stick your fingers completely inside yourself to retrieve it, and you can neatly empty it into a toilet or shower."

      "The saalt disc and bambody panties are the dream. I wish I'd had them my entire menstruating life instead of just the very end. Why bambody? The fabric is as little synthetic as can still be functional. I hate the slinky, sweat trapping not cotton, shudder. But more importantly, the protection goes band to band. I paid hundreds of dollars, trying all of the brands. The absorbent layer stops so low in front that I bleed over them. They are comfy enough that my daughter and I wear them every day. They are just our undies. I didn't have enough cycles to try more cups/discs etc. But the handful of times I used the salt disc, it was life changing. Like I wasn't even bleeding except when I peed. Put it in, dumps when I sit on the toilet. I did have a hell of a time getting it out, needs more than just a lip.",
      "I use the saalt menstrual cup. I\u2019ve had two children and am on hormonal birth control, so ymmv, but I can use it every day of my period. I dump it out more frequently on heavier days, but if I have it in right, it doesn\u2019t leak. When I empty it in the toilet, I just wipe it out with toilet paper and re-insert it. I sanitize it by filling a mug with water and microwaving it for 3 minutes.",
      "I use bambody period underwear. I think I have 10-12 pairs. I usually just use 7-8 though, per period. They've been life changing for me--I just have to change them every 24 hours, sometimes every 12 hours the first day or two. My period is on the lighter side, though I could imagine they might be a pain in the ass for someone with a heavy flow.",
      "You've already had some great feedback here, but I just wanted to mention a specific issue I experience with period underwear that I don't often see discussed. They make me sweat like crazy. They cause awful swamp ass for me, and I'm not generally a hugely sweaty person. it could be that other brands would be fine, but I wanted to mention it.",
      "I started with pads and now use them as liners from my discs, started out with a lumma disc, which worked with the pads, but too soft to wear on its own- I had an accident as a consequence one Christmas, so I got a firmer one from pixie cup Pads get stored in a bag or bucket till I get to wash them, I put in in on a quick wash and then add my clothes, that way I don\u2019t have to leave them in the bathroom"

      "I wonder if it's a person you know? Only cause all you really need to use points in store is an email or a phone number. They dont ask for ID proof of your name or anything. I mean I know friends who order loads of stuff at Sephora and technically I could go in and just give them a phone number and use their points. But, who does that! Also, can you see any of the info of the girl who bought stuff on your account? Like credit card name or anything? edit- I saw earlier in the day a girl on Tik Tok saying a random girl ordered things on Ultra's website using her account points!!! Idk how that works though online... but the girl whose points where stolen got an email showing that her points were used and the name/address the items are being sent too. So, there is proof! Now, if the thief of points was smart she would have picked up the stuff in store so no name proof was disclosed.",

I naturally contacted customer care to inform them of the anomaly and they told me they will escalate the matter to other department and haven\u2019t updated me since. Should I inquire about it again or escalate it again? Its not the birthday gift I regret losing out on but the fact that somebody stole from my account?",
