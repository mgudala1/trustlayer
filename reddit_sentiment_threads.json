When we were done drinking, we needed our water bottles off the platform, so we tossed them 30ft onto the ground.

Skin tone matters a lot too. I dont really burn unless I am outside for an hour+ at high uv index but am paradoxically reasonably pale. I have to be consistent about getting outside too if I try to get all my sun on the weekends, that doesn't work either. \n\nI often eat lunch outside at work or come home and lie out in the sun with a book for 25 minutes. If I am going to be out much longer than 30 minutes under high uv index or an hour under moderate uv index, I will apply sunscreen. There is SPF 15 sunscreen, which is helpful for getting sun without burning for people with more pale skin who are more prone to burns. Protecting my skin from burns and excessive sun exposure is important to me so I do carry both SPF 15 and 50 and use them appropriately depending on the situation. \n\nBalancing the risk of skin cancer vs vitamin D deficiency is a personal balancing act, and everyone has to assess their own risk. However for me, I feel so much better getting my vitamin D from the sun than I do from supplements.",

A lot of people don\u2019t realise how important proper dosing is when recovering from deficiency.\n\nBut \u2014 and this is important \u2014 it\u2019s best to **take Vitamin D3 with Vitamin K2** to help direct calcium properly into the bones and prevent build-up in the arteries. You can either pair the D3 with Vegishake\u2019s [**Vitamin K2 MK-7**](https://www.vegishake.co.uk/product/vitamin-k2-mk7/), or just go for their [**combined D3 + K2 formula**](https://www.vegishake.co.uk/product/vitamin-d3-and-k2-mk7-capsules/), which makes things easier if you want an all-in-one option.\n\nI found it helpful not just for physical health, but also to support **mental clarity and stress resilience**, especially while addressing trauma and low T.

I was in a similar place (low energy, brain fog, poor recovery from stress), and what helped me was focusing on **natural testosterone support** \u2014 not just physically, but for mental balance too. Two supplements that stood out for me were **Tongkat Ali** and **Turkesterone**.\n\nThere\u2019s a UK-based brand I found called [**Vegishake.co.uk**](https://www.vegishake.co.uk/shop/) \u2014 they do clean, no-filler **organic supplements** and their [**Tongkat Ali capsules**](https://www.vegishake.co.uk/shop/) are specifically aimed at supporting **testosterone levels**, energy, and recovery. They also stock **Turkesterone**, which a lot of guys in fitness and mental wellness communities are turning to as a natural anabolic and adaptogen for **hormonal balance** and **performance** without synthetic hormones.\n\nMight be worth looking into while you wait on your cortisol and thyroid tests \u2014 supporting your body naturally while you figure things out medically can sometimes give that extra edge.

You should try Tongkat Ali and Cistanche first. Both boost testosterone, and both have adaptogenic properties; meaning they can help with stress and typically anxiety as well. Try them one at a time, and you should add in 5mg of Pregnenolone as well. You could also try Shilajit (be careful a lot are fake), Ashwagandha (cycle it), DHEA, Zinc, and/or Boron. Tonkgat+Cistanche+Shilajit+DHEA+Pregnenolone is a very potent stack that all pair very well with eachother.\n\nFurthermore, if you do take Vitamin D3, it's best to take it with K2 and for most with Magnesium as well. You shouldn't just take D3 on its own. Make sure you're also eating healthy and getting enough vitamins and minerals. Taking a B-Complex could be beneficial.\n\nAdditionally, for trauma Polygala is typically a game changer for most. It's best taken at 100mg dosed 3 times throughout the day, for a total of 300mg, but you can just do 50-300mg dosed once in the day if you wanted to. You could also try Gotu Kola, an incredibly potent anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) herb; Holy Basil, a very calming herb that can help with anxiety, plus it is an \"adaptogen\", so it can help with stress; Sarcosine, a chemical already found in the body with natural antidepressant effects; or Saffron, a very potent mood booster with antidepression and anti-anxiety properties. If budget isn't as much of an issue, or you're just going to take 1-3 things or so, SAM-e could potentially be of great use too, which like Sarcosine is already found in the body. If your SAM-e levels are low, you're not going to be able to cope with stress very well at all. It is also a mood booster, can improve cognition, anti-anxiety, may boost energy, and can do other various things potentially as well. I'm currently taking it and it helps, but it's like ~50/50 whether it works for someone or not.",

He doesn\u2019t work, just sleeps, eats, and gambles again.\n\nIs it possible to block or ban all online gambling websites from my Wi-Fi? Please help. I'm tired I can't talk about this anymore to my family or the source of problem (the gambling addict)..\n\n(EDIT: Thank you for all your help. I will try all of your suggestions. Yes, it will take time, but I really hope it will works. And i'm sorry if i cannot or late to reply all of your comments.)",

It's typically quite easy, but i need to get a bit technical first by explaining the concepts.\n\nIt can also be bypassed.\n\n\nwhen you go to a website i.e. reddit.com - your computer doesn't know where that is.\n\nSo it consults your modem, which in turn consults your ISP's DNS server\n\nEvery computer on the internet has an IP address\n\nThis is a number - like reddit.com translate to 151.101.193.140 when you ping it.\n\nThink of it like the address book on your smartphone.\n\nYou can't remember everyones number - instead you assign a name to each number so you can quickly locate and ring them.\n\n\nSo, if we redirect your modem to stop using your ISPs DNS, and instead use an external 3rd party DNS server that blocks gambling sites, then what will happen that when his device tries to use your Wi-Fi, your modem will refuse to tell him the correct address.\n\nhttps://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security/\n\n\nhttps://support.opendns.com/hc/en-us/sections/206253667-Individual-Router-Configurations\n\nHere's the categories you can choose to block if you sign up for a free account and choose the custom filters\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/nPVCT3U\n\nIf you set this on the Router, then all computers and devices in the household are blocked.\n\nHowever, if he;s technically inclined, he could bypass it by setting a custom DNS on his computer/phone/tablet etc.\n\nHe could also use a smartphone hotspot to bypass the DNS filter.\n\nSo if you could covertly get access to his devices - you could also set the same DNS on them,\n\nProbably a VPN would bypass that.

Hell, even smart TV's do it nowadays. Try it, have a phone nearby and talk about some random thing you're looking to buy. Maybe new tires for a Case tractor? Do it a few times and you'll start seeing advertisements for replacement tractor tires. \n\nWhat I recommend you don't do, is tip-toe around the subject. An addiction is like a disease, and getting the person themselves to recognize it as a problem is a good step towards a solution.  \nIf the addict is an adult, talk about it. Take away their means of putting money into online gambling. If they use things like creditcards, call up the company, tell them to not allow transactions towards gambling providers. Ask the addict to work with you as much as you can, you don't want to enter the territory of being the wrongdoer. Get professional help dealing with this.\n\nIf it's a minor, take away their devices, only allow them under direct supervision. Take away their means of putting money towards gambling, also get professional help.",

So I instead waited a few weeks and bought the newer version of the headphones instead and this time took their advice to opt in for the 3 year warranty. Only recently a friend pointed out that ACL probably protects me in this case and my brief research indicates so. But I'm unclear on how to move forward as its now a year and bit past the date the broke and even if I was entitled to some compensation I have no idea how much or what for, being a retail employee myself, what I do know is I'm either going to deal with a smug overconfident representative or an employee who will simply stick to the rules as that's what we're technically taught, and my past experience literally left me misinformed, so I have to know my stuff before I do anything. Anyone got advice or relevant experiences they can share?\n\nFor context, the headphones were used during commutes, gym and at my desk at home while studying, ACL is Australian consumer law and I have only recently learnt that it overrides manufacturer warranties in cases of faulty items, and from what I can tell, ACL entitles me to compensation for this as the retailer misinformed me and tried to make me pay a repair charge they're responsible for.

These panties are now to the end of their life, and I wanted to purchase new ones that are made with organic cotton as opposed to conventionally grown cotton. I ordered from Pact and the panties had a lining that wasn't sewn down in the front. It was weird to me and I didn't like it, so I figured I'd order from the brand Quince for panties that had the lining sewn down in the front. The lining was just like the ones from Pact, not sewn down! (Quince panty is unworn and pictured above.)\n\nIs this a \"feature\" and not a \"bug\"? Are you supposed to put a pantyliner in that pocket, or is it just sloppy sewing? Does anyone know a brand that does organic panties that does take the time to sewn down the lining on both sides? I don't like how the fabric will sometimes move into places where I don't want it throughout the day.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ds4a8vza3w7f1.jpeg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa205320b79aeba57f5d19a135551c8081eb69f3",

All the size charts online have me closest to a US 10 or 12 at least for the bust and hips, but they all expect my waist to be 80cm or below and hollow to hips to be 152cm (maxi of course). Is there more wiggle room with the waist typically or am I doomed to size up and have the bust taken in every time? AND A 22CM DIFFERENCE FOR LENGTH!!! Why do they think women of my proportions have to be so tall?! I know I could hem them, but I am awful at sewing and I'm scared of ruining a dress I spent a lot of money on.\n\nAt this point I just worry I'm cooked and any dress I buy online will need $200 in alterations (its happened before) but I figure experienced fashionistas would have some input.\n\nSome context for why I'm trying online: I already dislike clothes shopping in general, so trying to find wedding guest dresses has been an absolute nightmare. To be fair I can be very particular about the colour and general style I'm looking for but going to brick-and-mortar shops has been very discouraging as each dress either isn't what I'm looking for or just fits terribly and my self-image crumbles. Hence trying online shopping so that I can try them on at home and return if needed gives me access to more options and a more comfortable space for me to be disappointed.\n\nThanks in advance for any input/advice :)",

Any stock you might find somewhere like Amazon is from third party sellers listed at heavily inflated prices.\n\nWhen the 5700X3D was at ~$200USD (or even less from AliExpress sellers) it was an easy call versus spending the extra on new mobo/RAM to go AM5 with a 7600 or similar.\n\nWith the current pricing those third party sellers are asking, and options like the 9600X now regularly available at that $200 price point, it\u2019s a much less simple choice. A lot of people would actually just be better off selling their AM4 CPU/mobo/RAM while there\u2019s still some value left in it and upgrading to AM5 rather than overspending on a new-old-stock 5x00 X3D chip. Remember that we\u2019re still talking about chips based on the now 5 year old Zen 3 architecture. The huge cache can do some incredible things, but it can\u2019t magically make up for straight up core speed all the time. \n\nThat said, if you\u2019re regularly playing stuff like Warzone, Tarkov, MMOs, 4X, etc that can significantly benefit from the cache that\u2019s something that\u2019s worth factoring in. Otherwise most people would tend to be better off selling and upgrading to AM5 where they\u2019ll be getting pretty similar baseline performance right now and also have the future option of dropping in a Zen 6 X3D chip in a few years if they really need the boost.",

And when you really think about it, it's still a pretty hefty increase to go AM5 to an equivalent quality cpu of the one you are upgrading too on AM4. Meaning, if I had decided to go AM5 and gone with something equivalent to the 5900X on AM5 I would have had to have a minimum of 300$ extra. Which is a lot considering after shipping and taxes it only costed 300$ for the AM4 upgrade. In your situation though, I would have def heavily considered the 5900X or even 5950X over the 5700X because the way I figured it was, since I am remaining in AM4, at least I am gaining 6 extra cores (double). I know in gaming the 5700x, 5800x, and 5900X are probably pretty similar, but to me to make it worth it, now I get better frames AND a beefier cpu to multi task and do game dev stuff.

So, any GPU that\u2019s closer to the current generation will be better than a \u201cbest in class GPU\u201d from a few generations ago. This is especially true with Nvidia cards (which is what I have in all of my PCs, so it\u2019s not coming from someone pushing AMD). \n\nFor Nvidia cards, check the GeForce experience driver release log to see what cards they\u2019re still supporting. It\u2019s a bit of a dirty trick, but they\u2019ll notify you of \u201cnew drivers\u201d that you\u2019ll download and install even if they\u2019re not applicable to your card because they bundle all card drivers into a single cumulative package.",

That mindset led to big piles of laundry waiting until I had time to do it.

Who am I folding towels for? This ain't a hotel. Hang it on a hook. Cleaning rags? Get in a bin. My kid's clothes? Get in the bin. \n\nThen the actual clothes I don't want wrinkled, I fold and put away right then. \n\nI have a process flow too. When the hamper is full, do laundry. Clean and dry laundry goes into an big hamper I named the \"laundry inbox\". Then I sort it into my bins and individual hampers. My kids each have a small hamper and so do I. Now everyone can put their clothes up and my job is way easier. If the inbox is full, I don't just pile in more clothes waiting for the perfect opportunity...I sort. If I touch the clothes in my hamper I fold them (or at least a few).\n\nSo it's a constant process. It's never done. I just keep moving things forward. I should only touch the clothes once at each step (washing, drying, sorting, and folding). No more rifling through clothes to find something to wear and leaving them in the bin. I probably spend a few minutes on laundry every day and this works so well.",

For bigger, real life tasks, crossing out from to do list is SO satisfying.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd doing thing regularly to have small doses of this task every day. I press plants for my herbarium and sticking them carefully takes long and drains me. So I pick few flowers every 2-4 days, tape them, instead of spending whole hour labeling, searching and getting lost in the chaos. Basically: do task every day small dose of time-> it's enjoyable and you're more excited to even start it:)\u00a0\n\n\nI'm kinda productivity freak with those, but they make me little bit less doomed by daily stuff and sometimes feel fun.
